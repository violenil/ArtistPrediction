ABBA,Ahe's My Kind Of Girl,/a/abba/ahes+my+kind+of+girl_20598417.html,"Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?

Make your fingers soft and light  
Let your body be the velvet of the night  
Touch my soul, you know how

Go slowly with me now

Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies  
Please don't talk, go on, play  
Andante, Andante  
And let me float away  
  
I'm your music

Dean Martin,For The Good Times,/d/dean+martin/for+the+good+times_20198585.html,"Don't look so sad, I know it's over  
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning  
Let's be glad we had some time to spend together  
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window  
And make believe you love me one more time  
For the good times  
  
I'll get along, you'll find another  
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me  
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever  
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window  
And make believe you love me one more time  
For the good times

Death,Crystal Mountain,/d/death/crystal+mountain_20177670.html,"Built from blind faith  
Passed down from self-induced fantasy  
Turn a page to justify  
Conjuring power - it opens wide  
On seventh day,  
is that how it's done?  
Twisting your eyes to perceive  
all that you want  
To assume from ignorance  
Inflicting wounds with your  
cross-turned dagger  
  
[Chorus]  
Inside crystal mountain  
Evil takes its form  
Inside crystal mountain  
Commandments are reborn  
  
All the traps are set to confine  
All who get in the way of the divine  
In sight and in mind of the hypocrite  
A slave to the curse forever confined  
  
Shatter the myth  
Don't cut yourself  
On your words against  
dreams made of steel  
Stronger any faith  
That inflicts pain and fear,  
is that how it's done?  
Twisting your eyes to perceive  
all that you want  
To assume from ignorance  
Inflicting wounds with your  
cross-turned dagger  
  
[Chorus]

The Temptations,I'll Try Something New,/t/temptations/ill+try+something+new_20547746.html,"I will build you a castle with a tower so high  
Till it reaches the moon  
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly  
And compose you a tune  
Give you lovin' as warm as Mama's oven  
And if that don't do  
Then I'll try something new  
I'll try something new  
  
I will take you away with me as far as I can  
To Venus or Mars  
There we will love with your hand in my hand  
You'll be king of the stars  
Every day we can play on the Milky Way  
And if that don't do  
I'll have to try something new  
I'll try something new  
  
I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea  
To wear in your hair  
(Thank you)  
I'll do anything and every little thing to make you happy, boy  
To show you that I care  
I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellas  
And if that don't do  
Then I'll try something new  
I'll try something new

ABBA,Cassandra,/a/abba/cassandra_20002811.html,"Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour

ABBA,Chiquitita,/a/abba/chiquitita_20002978.html,"Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
I'm a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end

Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita

Hold me when the music starts  
All my dreams come true

Promise me you're mine tonight  
I've been waitin' lyin' tonight  
While the lights are low

In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)  
  
You know it's not my imagination  
Or a part of the orchestration  
Love was here at the culmination  
I'm the king and you're the queen of hearts  
  
Time will pass and tears will fall  
But someday we'll both recall  
Moments made of this  
Golden memories  
  
(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)  
  
In a once and future dream  
Where the dances never seem to start  
  
(Hoh) Did I dream that we danced forever  
In a wish that we made together  
On a night that I prayed would never end? (end)

But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same  
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame

Why did things turn out so bad?

Don't want to play no games  
I won't tease you and it won't stall you  
But don't you think it's all you?  
If you want sex than it's all you!  
And NO I don't want your number  
And NO I don't want to call you  
  
Choose you wanna make me choose  
You got to show me something now  
Why I should be with you?  
  
Choose you wanna make me choose  
You got to show me something now  
Why I should be with you?  
  
You wanna make me choose  
You wanna make me choose  
You wanna make me choose  
You wanna make me choose

ABBA,Fernando,/a/abba/fernando_20002896.html,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...

ABBA,Fernando (In Spanish),/a/abba/fernando+in+spanish_20930420.html,"Puedes escuchar Fernando?  
Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras

Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

ABBA,Free As A Bumble Bee,/a/abba/free+as+a+bumble+bee_20003016.html,"I'm down and I feel depressed  
Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw

ABBA,From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel,/a/abba/from+a+twinkling+star+to+a+passing+angel_21001358.html,"Twinkle, Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room.

ABBA,Gimme Gimme Gimme,/a/abba/gimme+gimme+gimme_10001506.html,"Half past twelve  
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
