0,Gordon Lightfoot,I'd Do It Again,/g/gordon+lightfoot/id+do+it+again_20061651.html,"A one man band on a one night stand  
As a one man band should be  
The cried for more, he replied why sure  
And he played one just for free  
The sounds he laid down. the songs he played  
Made the ladies all come to call  
He was born in the back of a Seminole bus  
On the road to Niagara Falls  
  
I'd do it again, I'd do it again  
I'd do it again  
  
The one man band philosophical man  
Didn't lie when he said to us  
I seen the high rollers come and go  
It's the holy rollers I trust  
The man said then he was sixteen when  
He retired from the county school  
A wee bit thin with a will to begin  
He was known to be know man's fool  
  
I'd do it again, I'd do it again  
I'd do it again  
  
The one man band was a mighty good man  
Cause he played 'til the break of dawn  
He ups and downs about four more rounds  
And he stayed 'til the crowd went home  
It seemed to me like he never could be  
Like anything I'd ever seen before  
When he stepped from the stage  
With his ax in his hand  
And he run through the backstage door  
  
I'd do it again, I'd do it again  
I'd do it again  
  
A one man band on a one night stand  
As a one man band should be  
They cried for more, he replied why sure  
And he played one just for free

2,Donna Summer,Breakaway,/d/donna+summer/breakaway_20042195.html,"For too long she was feeling  
That her love had lost it meaning  
She was looking for a reason  
Not to breakaway  
But I don't think she can take it  
  
She'll be strong enough for two although  
It's hard for her to do  
She'll breakaway  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway  
  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
And breakaway  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway  
  
It's a secret she's been keeping  
It's been eating at her heart  
Wish I could find the words to tell you  
But I don't know where to start  
And when she looks into the future  
She sees too many problems  
There are so many reasons  
She should pack up the past  
And breakaway  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway  
  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
And breakaway  
Forget about the bad times  
Remember all the good times  
Hold your head up high  
  
Oh, oh, oh she'll breakaway

3,George Strait,Love Is Everything,/g/george+strait/love+is+everything_21061484.html,"Love is everything  
It's a whole lot more than going to the store for a wedding ring  
It's kissin' and a huggin' but it's also the kicking and the cussing thing  
I've been told  
  
Love is everything  
It's a smile on your face on a cold winter day at the thought of spring  
It's getting up at night for the cry of a little bitty baby thing  
And it's growing old  
  
Love is everything  
It's those fires that daddy stoked those nights to keep you warm  
It's the hell your mama went through the day you were born  
And it's a thunderstorm  
  
Love is everything  
Oh, it's going off to war, it's the back and forth on a front porch swing  
It's the kiss that you got in the old parking lot of a Dairy Queen  
And it's you and me  
  
Love is everything  
It's looking out for everybody else but number one  
And it's all that really matters when all's said and done  
And the race is run  
  
Love is everything  
It's a rose on a stone, it's the words in a song that the choir sings  
It's the tears of goodbye and the place that you fly to, to get your wings  
Yeah love's the king  
Love is everything  
Love is everything

4,Gordon Lightfoot,On The High Seas,/g/gordon+lightfoot/on+the+high+seas_20061561.html,"Was it someone she met that's so hard to forget  
Was it some kind of an ocean of changes  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
And since I don't know, let me guess  
Was it somewhere in Michigan or the Lake of the Woods  
Up in old Montreal or Toronto the good  
Somewhere in Reno or somewhere in Rome  
And when all is said and done  
Will she leave me alone  
  
I don't want to get so low  
And as for my sadness, it comes and it goes  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
Back in the city or on the high seas  
  
Was it up in Hornpayne where the trains run on time  
Was she drinking champagne when she made up her mind  
North of the border or down in South Bend  
And when all is said and done  
Is there no rainbow's end  
  
I don't want to own the key  
To some ghostly mansion where souls are set free  
I don't remember where she said she would go  
Straight for the highway or down the low road  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
Back in the city or on the high seas

Our love, a fadin mem'ry as I chase another down.  
My eyes are gettin' heavy and my head's spinnin' 'round.  
Stil wond'rin if she'll ever come home.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned.  
Closing time, I drive for home not feelin' any pain.  
Thoughts of her drift back tome through the fallin' rain.  
Not caring if she ever come shome.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.

6,Gordon Lightfoot,Brave Mountaineers,/g/gordon+lightfoot/brave+mountaineers_20061546.html,"Born in the country and I like that country smile  
Of the little girls and boys, they remind me of a child  
That I knew and a big harvest moon  
That shon' by suppertime in the dusty afternoon  
  
And I need to be there  
When the autumn wind goes whistlin' through the trestle we would climb  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
  
Born in the country and I like that country song  
We played for just a nickel every time we got to town  
And I bought you a dime diamond ring  
In the hayloft we would play, we were princesses and kings  
  
And I need to be there  
When the world gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
  
Born in the country and I like that country way  
Of the uncles and the cousins and the card games they would play  
While the young ones slept overhead  
Beneath the quilts that mother made, when all the prayers were said  
  
And I need to be there  
When the autumn wind goes whistlin' through the trestle we would climb  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
  
And I need to be there  
When the world gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time

7,Alabama,Between The Two Of Them,/a/alabama/between+the+two+of+them_20163424.html,"They married back in '32  
They were young and love was new  
And every day the feeling grew  
Between the two of them  
When work grew scarce and times got bad  
The hope would chase away the sad  
And hope was sometimes all they had  
Between the two of them  
The 40's came and the 50's went  
And the mortgage replaced the rent  
They made the most of each day spent  
Between the two of them  
Their children all turned out just fine  
So he retired in '69  
And left with oh so little time  
Between the two of them  
Today I brave the graveyard rain  
And placed a rose between their names  
Now that's the most that ever came  
Between the two of them  
And though I miss them oh so much  
His crooked smile her gentle touch  
And the pleasure of just growing up  
Between the two of them

8,Donna Summer,Cold Love,/d/donna+summer/cold+love_20042350.html,"I'm walking the line  
I'm walking the line  
Treading thin ice  
Time after time  
  
I go for the best, end up with much less  
I need the real thing  
Forget all the rest  
  
Started out good  
Working out bad  
All the sweet love turner  
Sour and sad  
  
A face and name  
It's always the same  
So tired of playing love's foolish games  
Tell me why  
Love passes me by  
  
[Chorus]  
Cold love, cold love  
Another shot of rock 'n' roll love  
Cold love, cold love  
Whatever happened to that  
Good old love  
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why  
Tell me why, tell me why  
  
Hope in the dark, love in the light  
I'll keep on looking for someone  
Who's right  
  
I'm out for the best  
Can you stand the test  
I need the real thing  
No more and no less  
Tell me why  
Love passes me by

9,Gordon Lightfoot,The House You Live In,/g/gordon+lightfoot/the+house+you+live+in_20061658.html,"Go first in the world, go forth with your fears  
Remember a price must be paid  
Be always too soon, be never too fast  
At the time when all bets must be laid  
Beware of the darkness, be kind to your children  
Remember the woman who waits  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate  
  
When you're caught by the gale and you're full under sail  
Beware of the dangers below  
And the song that you sing should not be too sad  
And be sure not to sing it too slow  
Be calm in the face of all common disgraces  
And know what they're doin' it for  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're out on the road and feelin' quite lost  
Consider the burden of fame  
And he who is wise will not criticize  
When other men fail at the game  
Beware of strange faces and dark dingy places  
Be careful while bending the law  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're down in the dumps and not ready to deal  
Decide what it is that you need  
Is it money or love, is it learnin' to live  
Or is it the mouth you must feed  
Be known as a man who will always be candid  
On questions that do not relate  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate

11,Alabama,Spin The Wheel,/a/alabama/spin+the+wheel_20694857.html,"We're standing like kids on a mineway  
Two hearts like tumbling dice  
We've lost control of the way we feel  
  
Old heartaches driving us crazy  
Is it really different this time  
We've come too far not to take a chance  
And spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
  
This could be another broken heart  
Or is it were true love starts  
Only one way to find out if this thing is real  
Just spin the wheel  
  
Round and round our dreams are rollin?  
Will they land on lover goodbye  
My heart?s on you head over heels  
  
All I know is when I told you  
Love is worth any chance we take  
Baby let's left the chips fall were they make  
And spin the wheel  
  
Play our hearts on the line  
Risk it all one more time  
Let it all ride on the way we feel  
  
This could be another broken heart  
Maybe this is it were true love starts  
Only one way to find out if this thing is real

Just spin the wheel  
  
Keep on spinning the wheel baby  
Round and round we go  
Spin in the wheel  
Spin the wheel  
  
Round and round we go  
And spin the wheel  
Spin the wheel

12,Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Free,/b/bob+dylan/i+shall+be+free_20021595.html,"Well, I took me a woman late last night,  
I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.  
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,  
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""  
I hot-footed it, bare-naked  
Out the window!  
  
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,  
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.  
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride  
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.  
(Right there  
Proud as can be)  
  
I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed  
When a can a black paint it fell on my head.  
I went down to scrub and rub  
But I had to sit in back of the tub.  
Cost a quarter  
And I had to get out quick  
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna  
  
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,  
It's President Kennedy callin' me up.  
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""  
I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,  
Anita Ekberg,  
Sophia Loren.""  
Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!  
  
Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,  
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.  
Licks my face and tickles my ear,  
Bends me over and buys me beer.  
(She's a honeymooner  
A June crooner  
A spoon feeder  
And a natural leader)  
  
Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,  
I got a woman who works on the levee.  
Pumping that water up to her neck,  
Every week she sends me a monthly check.  
She's a humdinger  
Folk singer  
Dead ringer  
For a thing-a-muh jigger  
  
Late one day in the middle of the week,  
Eyes were closed I was half asleep.  
I chased me a woman up the hill,  
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.  
It was Little Bo Peep!  
(I jumped a fallout shelter  
I jumped a bean stalk  
I jumped a Ferris wheel)  
  
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,  
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.  
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,  
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.  
(He's eatin' bagels  
He's eatin' pizza  
He's eatin' chitlins  
He's eatin' bullshit!)  
  
Oh, set me down on a television floor,  
I'll flip the channel to number four.  
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man  
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.  
(It's that greasy kid stuff.  
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is  
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,  
Charles de Gaulle  
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)  
  
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen  
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.  
She takes about fifteen baths a day,  
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.  
(She's a little bit heavy!)  
  
Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,  
It levels my head and eases my mind.  
I just walk along and stroll and sing,  
I see better days and I do better things.  
I catch dinosaurs  
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor  
Catch hell from Richard Burton!)

13,Alabama,Dixie Boy,/a/alabama/dixie+boy_20005062.html,"I was raised in the shadows of an old cotton mill  
Back when believin' was the style  
Small town heaven and a big-eyed boy  
Made sweet music for a while  
My daddy worked hard down at the factory  
Nights he went to G.I. school  
He didn't know nothin' 'bout the silver spoon  
But he lived by the golden rule  
  
Summer nights he was gone me and mama stayed home  
Out on the front porch swing  
Wishin' on the stars in the southern sky  
And sometimes we used to sing  
  
We were leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of  
  
Got my real education from the T.V. station  
And good ole boys down at the park  
The say ""Hey, Willie"" and those rock-a-billies  
Made their way into my heart  
  
I remember the old folks sittin' 'round talkin'  
On laidback Sunday afternoons  
They said them young folks sure got a hard road  
Oh, they're growin' up too soon  
  
Now I know they were right, and as I sit here tonight  
Out on the front porch swing  
The stars are shinin' in my young boy's eyes  
Just like they did for me  
  
We are leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of  
  
We are leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys

The happy crowds are mingling

I'm sure that you'll forgive me  
If I don't enthuse

I've got the Christmas blues  
  
I've done my window shopping  
There's not a store I've missed  
But what's the use of stopping  
When there's no one on your list  
  
You'll know the way I'm feeling  
When you love and you lose  
I guess  
I've got the Christmas blues  
  
When somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you  
Christmas is a joy of joys  
But friends when you're lonely  
You'll find that it's only  
A thing for little girls  
And little boys  
  
May all your days be merry  
Your seasons full of cheer  
But 'til it's January  
I'll just go and disappear  
Oh Santa  
May have brought you  
Some stars for your shoes  
  
But Santa only brought me  
The blues  
Those brightly packaged  
Tinsel covered

16,Gordon Lightfoot,Cold Hands From New York,/g/gordon+lightfoot/cold+hands+from+new+york_20061511.html,"I came down through Albany to New York  
To find what I'd been missin'  
I looked across the river to the city  
Where the windows all stood glistenin'  
I stood listenin'  
Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside  
But I was young and able  
When I came out the other end  
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble  
Unreadable  
I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go  
I thanked him  
A face of white, a face of brown  
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger  
For a stranger  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me""  
I came down to live alone in New York  
The city of the living  
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men  
Were taking, none we giving  
Or forgiving  
Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways  
I saw them  
There were men who lived in style and others who had died  
Where no one knew them  
Beause they couldn't win  
There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms  
Where babies crept unwanted  
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope  
Or if it mattered what they did  
Or if they lived  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me""  
I came down through Albany to New York  
To find what I'd been missin'  
I looked across the river to the city  
Where the windows all stood glistenin'  
I stood listenin'  
And there were prophets in the squares  
And people there who smiled and said, ""Forget it""  
There were lovers in the park  
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it  
So afraid of it  
And there were preachers of the Word and poets  
Who were never heard, I heard them  
There were those who would not try to learn  
The measure of the lie they're livin'  
I heard a young musician play in a place  
Where they paid you not to listen  
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by  
And offered their best wishes  
That's how it is  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York  
Cold hands from New York

Sometimes it gets so hard, you see  
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet  
With all these promises you left for me  
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick  
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me  
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic  
When you knew I had some other place to be  
Now where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously  
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.  
  
Well, six white horses that you did promise  
Were fin'ly delivered down to the penitentiary  
But to live outside the law, you must be honest  
I know you always say that you agree  
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well I don't know how it happened  
But the river-boat captain he knows my fate  
But ev'rybody else, even yourself  
They're just gonna have to wait.  
  
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets  
The Persian drunkard, he follows me  
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can't unlock it  
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key  
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed  
That a man can't give his address out to bad company  
And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad  
In the ruins of your balcony  
Wond'ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie?

If I don't to face the morning sunrise for a while  
I'll get along you know I'll take tomorrow with a grin  
If I never have to think about her love again  
  
And I won't mind if words are spoken  
In empty love songs as long as I don't have to hear  
I'll be alright if I don't have to face the world again  
And if I never love again I'll be alright  
  
Last night she gave the final word, she said her last goodbye  
And disappeared forever in the world outside  
One kiss and then she took her leave to go I know not where  
Into the misty shadows of the midnight air  
  
But I won't mind if words are spoken  
In empty love songs as long as I don't have to hear  
I'll be alright if I don't have to face the world again  
And if I never love again I'll be alright  
And if I never love again I'll be alright

The first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth turn in my hand  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command my love

The first time ever I lay with you  
And felt your heart beat close to mine

Is there anybody home?

Who can tell me where I am?  
Oft times, I recall when there wasn't no need to lie  
So much was said but we never did say goodbye  
Oh, how I long to hear you whisper in my ear  
Is there anybody home, don't you know I'm all alone?  
Can you tell me where I am?  
All I can do is love you 'til the end of all time  
One day, time will tell when you're living in yesterday  
Thinking of things to do, thinking of things to say  
Thinking of things divine, find a bottom line  
Is there anybody home?  
Is there anyone in there?  
Who can tell me where I am  
Oft times I recall, I was thinking of ways to win  
Ready to risk it, all until it wore thin  
Oh, how I long to hear you whisper in my ear  
Is there anybody home, don't you know, I'm all alone  
Can you tell me where I am?  
All I can do, is love you 'til the end of all time

The disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Steps into your eats into your soul  
Over your senses you have no control  
Ain't nothing too discreet about the disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right out of nowhere and you're down for the count  
From the outside world the pressure will mount  
Turn you into a piece of meat  
The disease of conceit.  
  
Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure  
They've done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure.  
  
There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people seeing trouble tonight fro the disease of conceit  
Give you delusions of grandeur an evil eye  
Give you the idea that you're too good to die  
The they bury you from head to feet  
From the disease of conceit.

Back up my truck, hook 'em up

That's all I've got to say  
Never had been thrown like this before  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
Never saw it comin'  
But I knew where it was goin'  
When she asked how long this time  
Before I hit the road  
She didn't come right out and say it  
But I sure got the message  
When I reached out to hold her  
That shoulder sure was cold  
Figured I'd just let goodbye run its course  
I ain't her cowboy anymore

Like the last few nights I spent with her  
I don't know where I went wrong  
Or if I did  
Like the good ol' boy I am  
I told her that I understand  
But Lord knows that I won't long as I live  
Seems lately every time it rains it pours  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
We met in Denver  
Settled down in Dallas  
The best days of my life  
Were the ones I spent with her  
You'd think that all that lovin' ought to count for something  
Guess I wore out my welcome  
Like the rowels of these old spurs  
That Casper sunset's what I'm shootin' for  
'Cause I ain't her cowboy anymore

And as for fortune  
And as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it appeared to the world  
They were all I desired  
They are illusions  
They're not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you, and hope you love me

In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.  
  
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go  
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow  
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast  
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last.  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me  
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be  
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train

Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all.  
What make me love my woman, she can really do the Georgia Crawl.

Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,

Never saying what she's thinking or feeling deep inside

Laughing out loud, lost in a crowd of fair weather friends

It was her night to find destiny and it was Me  
  
And we danced every song that they played, and talked until closing time

Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why.  
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed.  
And then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waited for the worst.  
  
Chorus:  
And he said, let me tell you a secret about a father's love,  
A secret that my daddy said was just between us.  
He said, daddies don't just love their children every now and then.  
It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen.  
  
When I became a father in the spring of '81  
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son.  
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end,  
I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him.

Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates.  
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake.  
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in.  
And then somewhere from the other side I heard these words again.

I remember it well  
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light  
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night  
Her long flowing hair came softly undone  
And it lay all around  
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side  
In the warmth of her love  
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  
And we played a game only she could win  
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget  
Then left with the answer I've never found yet  
""How long"", said she, ""Can a moment like this  
Belong to someone?""  
""What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die  
We must almost be born""  
So if you should ask me what secrets I hide  
I'm only your lover, don't make me decide

The folks back home wonder what happened to their Queen  
The mornin' papers told it in black and white, calling it another Hollywood
suicide

58,Bob Dylan,Desolation Row,/b/bob+dylan/desolation+row_20021424.html,"They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting  
the passports brown  
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in  
town  
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a  
trance  
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in  
his pants  
And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to  
go  
As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row  
  
Cinderella, she seems so easy, ""It takes one to know one,""  
she smiles  
And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style  
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. ""You Belong to Me I  
Believe""  
And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend, you  
Better leave""  
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go  
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row  
  
Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to  
hide  
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things  
inside  
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame  
  
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain  
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready  
for the show  
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row  
  
Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window for her I feel so  
afraid  
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid  
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest  
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness  
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow  
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row  
  
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a  
trunk  
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk  
He looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette  
  
As he when off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet  
  
Now you would not think to look at him, but he was famous  
long ago  
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row  
  
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup  
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up  
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the  
cyanide hole  
And she also keeps the cards that read, ""Have Mercy on His  
Soul""  
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow  
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row  
  
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're  
getting ready for the feast  
The Phantom of the Opera a perfect image of a priest  
They're spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more  
assured  
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning  
him with words  
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, ""Get Outa Here  
If You Don't Know  
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row""  
  
Now at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew  
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do  
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack  
machine  
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene  
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go  
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row  
  
Praise be to Nero's Neptune the Titanic sails at dawn  
And everybody's shouting, ""Which Side Are You On?""  
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's  
tower  
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold  
flowers  
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow  
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation row  
  
Yes, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the  
doorknob broke)  
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of  
joke  
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're  
quite lame  
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another  
name  
Right now, I can't read too good, don't send me no more  
letters no  
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row

When you're feelin' blue  
High stepping strutters who land in the gutters  
Sometimes need one, too.  
Take it or leave it or try to believe it,  
For you've been down too long,  
Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside, they just pass it on.

And I could tell she was leavin'

That night in 'Frisco Bay

She said give it away  
  
That big four poster king sized bed

Oh, we're both tired of fightin' anyway  
Just give it away  
  
Oh, I tried to move on  
But I found that each woman I held  
Just reminded me of that day  
  
When that front door swung wide open  
She flung her diamond ring  
Said, give it away  
Just give it away  
  
And I said, now honey  
Don't you even want your half of everything  
She said give it away  
Just give it away

So, I'm still right here where she left me  
Along with all the other things that she don't care about anymore  
Hmm  
  
Like that picture from our honeymoon  
That night in 'Frisco Bay  
She said give it away  
Well, I can't give it away  
That big four poster king sized bed  
Where all our love was made  
She said give it away  
Well, I can't give it away

A diamond ring  
And a lonely, broken heart  
Full of love  
And I can't even give it away

It takes a mighty man to live with lonesome  
Some big men might live with misery  
But there's one thing I know, for sure it's certain  
It's for sure it's gonna take a lot bigger man than me

A babe in a manger in swaddling clothes, it's you, it's me everyone knows  
  
The Christmas spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere  
Like th day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down  
  
I hear the sound of church bell ring, and I see kids and grown-ups sing  
A real live nativity scene, it's you, it's me, we all know what it means  
  
The Christmas spirit is in the air, the Christmas spirit is everywhere  
Like the day Christ was born in Bethlehem, the Christmas spirit has been  
coming down  
  
An it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King  
It's time for that eastern star to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time  
  
Yes, it's time to let the angels sing, it's time to praise the newborn King  
It's time for that eastern start to shine, it's time, it's Christmas time

I went up and yelled to him  
""Please, please, please""  
He said, ""Don't ya tell Henry

I looked down low, I looked above  
And who did I see but the one I love  
She said, ""Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry

I spotted a horse and a donkey too  
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few  
The said, ""Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry

Now, I went down to the pumphouse the other night  
A-lookin around, it was outa sight  
I looked high and low for that big ol' tree  
I did go upstairs but I didn't see nobody but me

Early Sunday morning around breakfast time  
I heard a sudden tapping at the kitchen door  
Oh and there was more  
Well it was you I saw  
No mistake  
I knew you'd come around that sad look on your face  
Then you begged me to come in and I said yes  
Oh what a fool I am  
I should have turned away  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
To let it all hang out  
To fight my fear and fight my doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
(get ahold) of love  
Spoken words don't mean enough  
No mistake  
Remember not to break the promise that you make  
I'll meet you fifty fifty in the middle now  
And I won't back out  
There'd better be no doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love would bring you to my door  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love was on our side  
I love you you know I  
You know I always will love you now  
I know I do love you  
You know I'll always be true to you my love  
Here you stand  
Torn up yellow T-shirt and guitar in hand  
I wanna love you now  
Oh forget the past  
I wanna make love last  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Let it all hang out  
Love will bring you back again  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that I love will bring you back again

Nothing left to say

Lived on po'boys too

He worked since he was 5  
He dropped his wings on my train one day  
And never learned to fly  
  
I wonder what it takes to be  
Someone who knows why  
The earth ain't round  
Unless you can  
Teach yourself to fly  
  
And I said  
Ride over backwards

Some days in lifetime you gotta be brave  
Dig on your knees sometimes  
Sometimes you even gotta pray

Sometimes I feel like I'm going down, going down  
Going down for the very last time  
Oh don't know what it is, don't know what it is  
Sometimes I feel like going down  
  
Deep in my heart I pray

As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth  
And mystery replaces what thought we knew  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
The one dimension only shows one side  
But do we see the same through different eyes  
As you and I peer into life's kaleidoscope  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
Eternal sands of time shift endlessly  
Behind a veil of motionless disguise  
An eyelid flash is all it really seems to need  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone

Even if we're angels we can't ask  
To wander through the past  
The future is our goal  
The night is black as coal  
If I could pay the price  
I'd like to love you once  
I'd love to love you twice

Of the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises you keep  
When I am fast asleep  
To be where we belong  
Is all that I can ask  
We can do it in the shade  
As long as I have you  
And the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises we break  
If you made a clean mistake  
Well that's what love's about  
No need to stand and shout  
The truth is in your eyes  
The answer lies within  
No need to criticize  
  
Thanks  
For the promises at hand  
The abuse that we must stand  
Is often heaven sent  
They may not pay the rent  
You never can be sure  
When promises get bent  
  
Thank you for the promises that live  
This is all that I can give  
Forever in my mind  
To leave the past behind  
And seal it with a kiss  
Forever in my soul  
I will remember this

The victim of his minstrelsy

Eucalyptus trees hang above the street  
And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.  
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room  
With a golden loom.  
  
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine  
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.  
I see the hungry clouds up above your face  
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.  
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom  
With your golden loom.  
  
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light  
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.  
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail  
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.  
But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume  
And your golden loom.

In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox  
It's playing all my favorite memories  
One by one they take me back  
To the days when you were mine  
And i can't stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
I don't need no quarters  
Don't need any dimes  
You filled it up forever  
When you said goodbye  
Heaven knows i love old melodies  
They were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind that's playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane

Song by song those melodies  
Were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind that's playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane

No i can't stop this jukebox in my mind

96,Bob Dylan,Gates Of Eden,/b/bob+dylan/gates+of+eden_20021321.html,"Of war and peace the truth just twists  
Its curfew gull just glides  
Upon four-legged forest clouds  
The cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun  
Though its glow is waxed in black  
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden  
  
The lamppost stands with folded arms  
Its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Though it shadows metal badge  
All and all can only fall  
With a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
  
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand  
And then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf  
But still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay  
At ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
  
With a time-rusted compass blade  
Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks  
Side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise  
You will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
  
Relationships of ownership  
They whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly  
And wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs  
The lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The motorcycle black Madonna  
Two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause  
The gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey  
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The kingdoms of experience  
In the precious wind they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince  
Discuss what's real and what is not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The foreign sun, it squints upon  
A bed that is never mine  
As friends and other strangers  
From their fates try to resign  
Leaving men wholly, totally free  
To do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
  
At dawn my lover comes to me  
And tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words  
But these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

His overalls are black with dirt  
But his face is still full of dignity  
He talks about the waether  
And he can tell you when it's gonna rain  
Told me 'bout the flood of Twenty-Nine  
That washed the crops away  
  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
Grandpa told me 'bout the things he'd seen  
Underneath that Alabama sky  
I listened to my Grandpa's memories  
  
At times he mentions Grandma  
Turn his head and wipe away a tear  
Sometimes we'd take her picture down  
And sit and pretend that she's still here  
Three girls and two boys he raised on love  
And simple honesty  
And when they fin'lly have to carry him away  
They'll take a lot of me

I want to hear it from you  
  
I want to hear it again  
I want to know if the soft scented touch of your lips  
Must be taken away like a mother's first kiss to the life that she gives  
  
I've got a right to get it straight from you  
To give my life a different point of view  
To find a way to keep from losing you  
  
If you don't know what to say  
To understand is my life and the question is why  
You should cry in the night while your eyes look away  
Every time that I speak and there's nothing to say  
  
I want to hear it from you  
I want to hear it from you  
Let me know how you feel  
You've got to make up your mind  
Tell me where I can run  
When my roof tumbles in  
  
I want to hear it from you  
I want to hear it from you

She might have stopped right in her tracks  
Now I find my poor heart saying  
I'd like to have that one back  
  
I can almost see her standing there  
Tears rolling down her face  
As she packed away her memories  
In that old worn out suit case  
If I'd only known then what I know now  
I'd never open that door  
Oh they just don't make hearts like her's any more

I wouldn't here my poor heart saying

To be in biscuit city by and by

And the beach is white as snow  
And everyone's got money  
And no place to go  
In a land of milk and honey  
It can really make you smile  
And if I had a ticket  
I would stay in biscuit city for a while  
All the girls are in bikinis  
All the boys are in the buff  
With the baby in between and  
That makes three of us  
And the streets are all so quiet  
And the walls are squeaky clean  
I think you ain't been nowhere 'til  
The town of biscuit city you have seen

Lot of things can get in the way when you're tryin' to do what's right

You'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
I'm not sorry for nothin' I've done  
I'm glad I fought - I only wish we'd won  
The Siamese twins are comin' to town  
People can't wait - they're gathered around

I never wanted to go back there - I'd rather have died

I'm stark naked, but I don't care  
I'm going off into the woods, I'm huntin' bare  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you  
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew  
  
I'm here to create the new imperial empire  
I'm going to do whatever circumstances require  
I care so much for you - didn't think that I could  
I can't tell my heart that you're no good

And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears  
You don't understand it - my feelings for you

Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
I begin to wake up, how wrong it was to cling to you  
Sometimes I wish to hold you in my heart

Was the easiest thing that I ever could do  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know  
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow  
As I wander I return, to days gone by there's much to be learned  
Sometimes I wish that miracles could be  
But at best I fail to see any happening  
Some gotta lose and some gotta win

Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know

113,Gordon Lightfoot,A Message To The Wind,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+message+to+the+wind_20061694.html,"I saw a moonlit scene, I never will forget  
I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark  
I poked my head out silent, that's how it started  
What to my eyes appeared as dust  
Became a vision I don't know  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the day wore on I knew  
Another lonely night could never be  
If there's is a reason you might try and forget  
I'd like to find it 'cause I like to relive it  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue?  
I was caught drifting disappearing from the land  
Whitecaps in profusion all around me  
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength  
To sail upon the raging sea  
If theres a reason for the way that life is  
I'd like to find it after all who's life is it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the days wore on I knew  
Another lonely night with you could never be  
I saw a moonlit scene I know it was real  
All that you can ever do when love is reveal  
Sometimes I every try why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue?

Like a shadowy ghost at dawn he came and he went  
Through the woodland swiftly gliding, to the young maid he came gliding  
Where she'd run to meet him, by the garden wall  
Oh my sweet Miguel, I will never tell  
No one will ever know, what I know too well  
And he'd smile and lay his head on her breast and he'd say I have no fear  
They're waiting for me to cross the border, to swim the river  
'Cause I've done that before  
To see my true loves smiling face  
A hundred times or more  
Oh my sweet Miguel she cried  
I'll love you till I die  
He was born to the south in Mexico they say  
The child of a man who had soon gone away  
But his mother loved him dearly and she would take him yearly  
To the great Cathedral in St. Augustine  
Oh my young Miguel, listen to the bell  
Of my poverty you must never tell  
And he cried himself to sleep in the night  
And he vowed to make things right  
So he took the gun down from the wall and he paid a call  
He knew she'd understand  
A lawman came to capture him  
The gun jumped in his hand  
Oh Miguel the mother cried  
You must run son or you'll die  
So the story is told of his true love cross the line  
As strong as the oak and as sweet as the vine  
And the child she bore him, came on the fateful mornin'  
When they sent him to his final rest  
Oh my sweet Miguel listen to the bell  
No one will ever know, of what I know too well  
Then she'd smile and lay the child on her breast  
And she'd say I have no fear  
I'm waiting for you to cross the border, to swim the river  
'Cause you've done that before  
To see your true loves smiling face  
A hundred times or more  
Oh my sweet Miguel she cried  
I'll love you till I die

Look in my eyes  
And remember wine, the music and amour  
The days grow stronger and longer  
With every glance

To find romance  
While dancers dance so close  
  
Deep inside to our dream of dreams  
Our theme of themes  
Romance  
  
Yes I'm falling watch me falling  
Something warm is turning inside of me  
Something warm is burning inside of me

I used to play till evening shadows come  
And then winding down that old familiar pathway  
I heard my mother call at set of sun  
""Come home, come home, it's suppertime  
The shadow's lengthen fast  
Come home, come home, it's suppertime  
We're going home at last""  
Some of the fondest memories of my childhood  
Are woven around suppertime  
When Mama used to call out from the back steps  
To the old home place, ""Come on home, son, it's suppertime""  
Oh, how I'd love to hear those words once more  
But you know for me, time is woven in the realization of the truth  
That's even more thrilling  
And that's when the call comes from the portals of glory  
To come on home, it's suppertime  
""Come home, come home, it's suppertime  
The shadow's lengthen fast  
Come home, come home, it's suppertime  
We're going home at last, we're going home at last""  
When all God's children shall gather 'round the table  
With the Lord Himself at the greatest suppertime of them all

123,Bob Dylan,Chimes Of Freedom,/b/bob+dylan/chimes+of+freedom_20021149.html,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing  
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight  
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain  
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning  
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened  
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail  
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder  
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze  
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder  
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind  
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind  
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales  
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position  
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts  
All down in taken-for-granted situations  
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute  
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute  
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed  
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones  
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look  
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended  
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.  
While sailing 'round the ocean,  
While sailing 'round the sea  
I'd think of handsome molly  
Wherever she might be.  
Don't you remember, molly  
You gave me your right hand?  
You said whenever you'd marry  
I would be the man.  
But you broke your promise  
Go with whom you please  
My poor heart is aching  
You are at your ease.  
I went to church last Sunday  
Molly came ridin' by  
I could tell her mind was changin'  
By the rovin' of her eye.  
I go down to the river  
Though everyone's asleep  
I think of handsome molly  
An' I begin to weep.  
So I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.

Heard these voices in my head  
Telling me ""you'll never escape""  
No you can't get away  
When the spirit in me said  
Your love could show me the way  
My whole life changed on that day  
Now I'm walking in the light all aglow  
All I see is sunshine in my eyes  
Skies of blue, it's true, I'm free  
  
[Chorus]  
Out from under shadows  
The only thing that matters  
Is that you've worked a miracle in me  
I'm free  
Now when clouds surround me  
They have no place around me  
All because your love has set me free  
I'm free  
  
From the time that I knew  
That I could find love in you  
My heart's been renewed  
Now all my dreams are coming true  
I was frightened in the cold  
Desperate when you found me in time  
You saved me from the world  
Got my life back in control  
Chased away the madness in my mind  
You saved me right in time  
Now the future's looking up  
Skies are blue, all because of you  
Got the sunshine in my life  
All aglow, baby, don't you know, I'm free

Hoping he would choose me for his partner  
For the high school dance  
I was standing outside the class  
  
But it wasn't me, but my best friend, he asked  
I went running back inside teary-eyed  
And left the two of them behind  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind

Oh, how I love him, but I can't even let him know  
'cause he loves my best friend  
But she don't care, she loves someone else  
And I asked my mama, and she said: love's unkind  
  
Love's so unkind  
She said: just keep it alive

In back of the eight ball in some misery  
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools  
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
They sailed right up to me, I said, ""What's it all about  
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out  
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real  
Let me tell ya 'bout it, brother, it was somethin' you could feel""  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely, I let twilight set the tone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace, that's a good long way to roam  
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
One more day on the calendar in my mind  
I am down at the break wall puttin' in some time  
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way  
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long piece from home  
Any way I can lose myself

I'm fading away, fading away  
Fading away, fading away

Or was it a day?  
I truly don't know  
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low  
By that soft and shining sea  
Did you respect me for what I did  
Or what I didn't do, or keeping it hid?  
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid  
Of everything you see?  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
I got the heart and you got the blood  
We cut through iron and we cut through mud  
Then came the warning that was before the flood  
That set everybody free  
Fools they made a mock of sin  
Our loyalty they tried to win  
But you were closer to me than my next of kin  
When they didn't want to know or see.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs  
Poverty and shame were theirs  
But all that suffering was not to be compared  
With the glory that is to be  
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave  
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved  
It'll go with me unto the grave  
And into eternity.

She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise  
She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""

She said she would never forget

It could even be like a myth  
Yet it's hard to think on that she's the same one

From darkness, dreams are deserted  
Am I still dreamin' yet?  
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk  
'Stead of acting like we never met  
If she ain't feelin' well then why don't she tell  
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?  
Without any doubt, she seems too far out  
For me to return to her chase  
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played  
Her mouth was watery and wet  
But now something has changed for she ain't the same  
She just acts like we never have met  
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess  
To anything I might've tried  
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong  
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide  
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling  
I remember her whispering yet  
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't  
She just acts like we never have met  
I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way  
Of this I can't say very much  
But if you want me to, I can be just like you  
An' pretend that we never have touched  
An' if anybody asks me, ""Is it easy to forget?""  
I'll say, ""It's easily done  
You just pick anyone

Just a novice in a business  
That's seldom what it seems  
  
And where are you goin' tar top  
Where's J.C. and the chosen few?  
I saw the flash without T.Gentry  
And B.V. left for Malibu  
  
I was July, hot and thirty, some years down the line  
When the boys touched the nation, unaware at the time  
I got to go to Texas, California, New York too  
A farm boy who is thankful to be standin' in his shoes  
  
But in the Bowery hangs the memories  
Of dreams that still come true  
Every time I see the spotlights  
I'm one of the chosen few  
  
And where are you going tar top  
J.C. and the chosen few  
There's no flash without T.Gentry  
B.V. where are you?  
  
Where are you goin' tar top  
Which direction will you take  
What's this contraband clamor  
About the music that you make?  
  
And where are you goin' tar top  
Is it country enough?  
Is it contemporary glamor?  
No it's us, just us

And set my wheels afire

Down in the black of a bottomless hole  
There's a few good second hand scenes

Painting pictures on the window pane  
Feelings my heart cannot explain  
Oh the silence, sounds like music  
Seems like I can hear a melody  
Baby that's what you do to me  
  
(chorus):  
One thing I'm sure of  
Whether it's wrong or it's right  
I only want to be with you, tonight  
And if you want me to  
Baby ask me to stay  
Heaven's just a whisper away  
  
Feel the magic, taking over  
Please don't stop before we lose control  
Baby just let your feeling go  
Soft and tender, like the morning  
We get closer than we've ever been  
We're almost to the rainbow's end  
  
(chorus):  
I heard the winds of forever  
Calling out my name  
It's paradise, when I'm with you  
I will never be the same  
  
Please don't wake me if I'm dreaming  
'cause this time, this one is coming true  
So glad to share my dreams with you

Well you ladies out there  
You know what I'm  
I'm talkin' 'bout ya  
But you wanna know something?  
Did you ever try to remember or  
Or just place up a memory in your mind  
And it always seems so far away  
So hard to find  
  
Memories  
Light the corners of my mind  
Misty water-color memories  
Of the way we were  
  
Scattered pictures  
Of the smiles we left behind  
Smiles we gave to one another  
(oh yesterday) for the way we were  
  
Can it be that it was all so simple then  
Or has time rewritten every line  
If we had the change to do it all again  
  
Spoken:  
Tell me, how many of you would live your lives again  
I would too  
You girls?  
  
Memories  
May be beautiful and yet  
What's too painful to remember  
We simply choose to forget  
And so it's the laughter  
We will remember  
Whenever we remember  
  
The way we were  
The way we were  
Whoaaahhhh

Reminds me of - the one I love  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The cowboys cry - ki-yip-pie-yi  
Deep in the heart of texas.  
The rabbits rush - around the brush

The coyotes wail - along the trail

The doggies bawl - and bawl and bawl

Where will you go when night closes in?  
Where will it lead? Will it ever end?  
Where will it stop?  
Losing a friend isn't what we had in mind exactly  
All we need is a friend I guess  
With my midnight star to guide through  
Clouds of loneliness  
You knew someone but was it love?  
So many years, push came to shove  
You had a dream, so they had one too  
You turned away, they were untrue  
In our early days we were too willing  
At the time we had yet to arrive  
Many a man and a woman found  
Trying to stay alive  
Where will you go? What will you do  
When your whole world ain't talking to you?  
Maybe you think you will see the light  
Baby, it's time you hope it's right  
And I'm all dressed up to be somebody  
All I need is a friendly face  
With my midnight crowd to glide through  
Clouds of empty space  
Seems like every time we turn around  
What we see could be anyone's guess  
Many a man and a woman found in  
Clouds of loneliness

To lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend  
Just to say I understand

At the dark end of the road  
Someone light the way with just a single ray of hope.

Show up in the strangest places  
And grace us with their mercies in our time of need.

And so we tried, never too close  
Never too near, dyin' in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
  
I remember when best friends were no mistaken  
Long before that freedom was forsaken  
Learnin' 'bout all the good things  
In the world worth believin'  
And so we tried, never too close  
Never too near, dyin' in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
  
I remember when jealous lovers would stick together  
When the days were warm and the nights more tender  
When the bonds of truth were not made to measure  
And so we tried, never too close  
Never too near, dyin' in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
Try, try as you will  
Following dreams never fulfilled  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm

That ol' silk cap they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day  
So he said lets run and have some fun before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand  
Runnin' here and there all around the square  
Sayin' catch me if you can  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop

But he waved goodbye sayin' please don't cry  
I'll be back again some day

When the pool of tears beneath my feet floods every newborn seed  
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere  
Toiling in the danger and the morals of despair  
  
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake  
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break  
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand  
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand  
  
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear  
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  
The sun beams down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way I'll always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  
  
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me  
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man  
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

Is somethin' you'll get onto  
But they say you've got to live there for a while  
And if you got the money  
You can get yourself a honey  
A written guarantee ta make you smile  
But it's snowin' in the city  
And the streets and brown and gritty  
And I know there's pretty girls all over town  
But they never seem ta find me  
And the one I left behind me  
Is the reason that I'll be Alberta bound  
  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
Alberta bound, Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound  
It's good to be Alberta bound

188,Gordon Lightfoot,Now And Then,/g/gordon+lightfoot/now+then_20061527.html,"I think this time you've said enough  
To make me want to leave this place  
Still I keep coming back for more of  
The same to fan the dying flame  
Here inside these walls that seem  
To move a little closer every day  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
Think about the good things now and then  
  
I think this time that was the best time  
That we two had ever known  
We tried the handle of the house  
Upon the shore and found the open door  
Once inside we found a curious moonbeam  
Doing dances on the floor  
We were only playing like two children  
Who had stayed away from school  
Two of us could not be wrong  
Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule  
  
I think this time we've learned enough  
To know that nothing is the same  
But still the pounding of my heart  
Hasn't changed and leavin's so strange  
Here among my thoughts of you  
I find a gentle longing to be free  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Take away the in-between  
Think about the good things now and then  
We will see the day when you  
Or I will stay or face up to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
And think about the good things now and then

Of a place that I love  
Even more than I usually do

It's a long road back  
I promise you  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow  
And mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
And I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams

A man he stares into a TV screen  
From the next apartment we hear music

TV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping  
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed  
She must be pretty rich  
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck

And there's always someone watching  
Eyes  
TV's and someone's watching  
Eyes  
In the kitchen someone's watching  
Eyes  
And the maid and butler's watching  
Eyes  
  
Silent sunbeams falling across the window  
Suddenly she awakens with surprise  
Day and night they always go so quickly  
In TV time...  
  
Her husband rushes in and in the meantime  
She just slightly smiles and turns her head  
He just whispers something to her softly  
God knows what he said...  
  
You know it wasn't very long  
Before the two of them were kissing  
She was his wife, he was her man  
But they knew what they were missing

Eyes  
They're getting in through your eyes  
Don't let them poison your mind...

O holy child of Bethlehem descend to us, we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in be born in us today  
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Immanuel

While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love  
O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth  
And praises sing to God the King and peace to men on Earth

Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.  
  
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost  
He's always off somewhere when I need him most.  
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill  
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love ya still.  
  
I come back to the town from the flaming moon  
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.  
I love to see you dress before the mirror  
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore I finally disappear?  
  
Everybody's wearing a disguise  
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.  
But me, I can't cover what I am  
Wherever the children go I'll follow them.  
  
I march in the parade of liberty  
But as long as I love you I'm not free.  
How long must I suffer such abuse  
Won't you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?  
  
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,  
The pot of gold is only make-believe.  
The treasure can't be found by men who search  
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.  
  
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,  
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.  
My head tells me it's time to make a change  
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange.  
  
One more time at midnight, near the wall  
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.  
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?  
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.

Returning from the war  
Though I know she knew the truth  
She also knew much more  
And the answer that she gave to all of us  
Whispered low saying  
True love survives

Is she dreaming does she know  
A secret I can't see  
Maybe there's a trace of truth  
In all that she believes  
  
For one day I took a look deep down inside  
A voice cried saying true love's alive  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
  
True is love is never-ending  
It's giving all and not pretending  
It's holding on although your heart  
Feels dead  
  
A quarter of a century of years  
Have gone by  
Still the dream of this peculiar  
Lady's kept alive  
So I'm holding tight to one who I desired  
A burning fire saying true love survives  
True love survives

To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,  
I spied the fairest damsel  
That ever did walk in chains.  
I offer'd her my hand,  
She took me by the arm.  
I knew that very instant,  
She meant to do me harm.  
  
""Depart from me this moment,""  
I told her with my voice.  
Said she, ""But I don't wish to,""  
Said I, ""But you have no choice.""  
""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded  
From the corners of her mouth,  
""I will secretly accept you  
And together we'll fly south.""  
  
Just then Tom Paine, himself,  
Came running from across the field,  
Shouting at this lovely girl  
And commanding her to yield.  
And as she was letting go her grip,  
Up Tom Paine did run,  
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me,  
""I'm sorry for what she's done.""

205,Gordon Lightfoot,Ode To Big Blue,/g/gordon+lightfoot/ode+to+big+blue_20061550.html,"The oceans of the world were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best  
Was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam  
  
Big Blue moved alone for a mighty blue was he  
And the battles of the whales was an awesome sight to see  
And he took them one by one and he drove them all away  
In the mating of the day he was the king  
  
Big blue had fifty wives and he sired forty sons  
Though most of them feel victim to the cruel harpoon guns  
Ah but he was too much wise to get caught by the gunners' eyes  
And so he lived at sea a hundred years  
  
His mouth was as large as a tunnel so they say  
His hide was thick as leather and his eyes quick and small  
And his back was all scarred by the times he got away  
And he knew the smell of whalers did Big Blue  
  
Big Blue passed away to his natural decay  
Beside the Arctic Circle as he travelled up that way  
And there never was a man who was born with a gunner's hand  
Who ever took a pan to Big Blue  
  
Now the gray whale has run and the sperm is almost done  
The finbacks and the Greenland rights have all passed and gone  
They've been taken by the men for the money they could spend  
And the killing never ends, it just goes on  
  
The oceans of the earth were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam

You know that ghost is me.  
And I will never be set free,  
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.

When you reach the part where the heartaches come,  
the hero would be me.  
Heroes often fail.  
And you won't read that book again  
Because the ending's just too hard to take.  
  
I walk away like a movie star  
Who gets burned in a three way script.  
Enter number two,  
A movie queen to play the scene  
Of bringing all the good things out in me,  
But for now love lets be real.  
  
I never thought I could act this way  
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back.

What a tale my thoughts could tell.  
Just like an old time movie  
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well.  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet,  
The story always ends.  
If you read between the lines  
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand  
The feeling that you LACK.  
  
I never thought I could feel this way  
And I got to say that I just don't get it.  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone  
And I just can't get it back.

We never know  
Where the winds of love will carry  
Our hearts unfold  
Into the hands of time  
  
Nothing will ever change  
This love we share  
No matter what it takes  
I will be there  
  
When the sun goes high  
You pray for clouds to break  
Reach up to the sky and pray for it to rain  
When the times get hard you rely on your faith  
We'll be together  
If there's any way at all  
It there's any way at all  
  
Don't be afraid  
'Cause we're in this love together  
We'll ride the waves  
'Til we reach the other side  
  
Your love is life to me  
None can compare  
Not as I live and breath  
I will be there  
  
When the sun goes high  
You pray for clouds to break  
Reach up to the sky and pray for it to rain  
When the times get hard you rely on your faith

But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

Shakin' hands with the clock

Looking into her eyes I'm thinking bout future plans  
And then I get the feelin' that the life that I'd been leadin'  
Ain't all it's cracked up to be  
Since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me  
  
I used like to spend the night sittin' on an old barstool  
Drinking wine and killing time with all over those other fools  
But since you took my hand I think I understand it ain't the way it out to be  
Since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me  
And I'm beginning to like  
Since I've been holding an angel a little heaven's rubbing off on me

Sure makes it hard to forget  
She's about as gone as a girl can get.  
  
She's outta here, she disappeared without a trace.  
More or less unimpressed by the tears on my face.  
Her destination unknown, she just dropped out of sight,

231,Bob Dylan,'Cross The Green Mountain,/b/bob+dylan/cross+the+green+mountain_20175524.html,"I cross the green mountain  
I sit by the stream  
Heaven blazing in my head  
I, I dreamt a monstrous dream  
  
Something came up  
Out of the sea  
Swept through the land of  
The rich and the free  
  
I look into the eyes  
Of my merciful friend  
And then I ask myself  
Is this the end?  
  
Memories linger  
Sad yet sweet  
And I think of the souls  
In heaven who will be  
  
Alters are burning  
The flames far and wide  
The fool has crossed over  
From the other side  
  
They tip their caps  
From the top of the hill  
You can feel them come  
All brave blood do spill  
  
Along the dim  
Atlantic line  
The rapper's land  
Lasts for miles behind  
  
The lights coming forward  
And the streets are broad  
All must yield  
To the avenging God  
  
The world is old  
The world is great  
Lessons of life  
Can't be learned in a day  
  
I watch and I wait  
And I listen while I stand  
To the music that comes  
From a far better land  
  
Close the eyes of our captain  
Peace may he know  
His long night is done  
The great leader is laid low  
  
He was ready to fall  
He was quick to defend  
Killed outright he was  
By his own men  
  
It's the last day's last hour  
Of the last happy year  
I feel that the unknown  
The world is so dear  
  
Pride will vanish  
And glory will rot  
But virtue lives  
And cannot be forgot  
  
The bells  
Of evening have rung  
There's blasphemy  
On the end of the tongue  
  
Let them say that I walked  
In fair nature's light  
And that I was loyal  
To truth and to right  
  
Serve God and meet your full  
Look upward beyond  
Beyond the darkness that masks  
The surprises of dawn  
  
In the deep green grasses  
And the blood stained woods  
They never dreamed of surrendering  
They fell where they stood  
  
Stars fell over Alabama  
I saw each star  
You're walking in dreams  
Whoever you are  
  
Chilled are the skies  
Keen is the frost  
The ground's froze hard  
And the morning is lost  
  
A letter to mother  
Came today  
Gunshot wound to the breast  
Is what it did say  
  
But he'll be better soon  
He's in a hospital bed  
But he'll never be better  
He's already dead  
  
I'm ten miles outside the city  
And I'm lifted away  
In an ancient light  
That is not of day  
  
They were calm, they were gloomed  
We knew them all too well  
We loved each other more than  
We ever dared to tell

232,Bob Dylan,Ballad In Plain D,/b/bob+dylan/ballad+in+plain+d_20021147.html,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.  
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,  
Gone as the season she's taken.  
  
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away  
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,  
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""  
And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""

But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast  
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun  
Crying like a fire in the sun  
Look out the saints are comin' through  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense  
Take what you have gathered from coincidence  
The empty-handed painter from your streets  
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  
This sky, too, is folding under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home  
All your reindeer armies, are all going home  
The lover who just walked out your door  
Has taken all his blankets from the floor  
The carpet, too, is moving under you  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue  
  
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you  
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you  
The vagabond who's rapping at your door  
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  
Strike another match, go start anew  
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Are you ready, hope you're ready  
Am I ready, am I ready?  
Am I ready, am I ready?  
  
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren  
And to take up my cross?  
Have I surrendered to the will of God  
Or am I still like the boss?  
  
Am I ready, hope I'm ready.  
When the destruction cometh swiftly  
And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well  
Have you decided whether you want to be  
In heaven or in hell?  
  
Are you ready, are you ready?

Or are you following the pack?

Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?  
Are you ready for Armageddon?

suitcase in her hand.  
Her fate she pondered, only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care.  
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was
grooving.  
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her,  
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?  
  
In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way,  
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one.  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care,  
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere.  
  
He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended,  
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended.  
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears,  
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him.

You play every chord in me  
At last the world will know  
That this is, this is no, no ordinary love song

A girl, a girl who hoped so long  
So long to find  
If I could be your love song  
Oh yes

Thunder and lightning  
Like never before  
'Cause that's how I feel  
Here in my heart  
If it's gonna rain  
Let the storm start  
  
If you're gonna leave go on and go  
Don't even look back  
When you hit the road  
If that's how you feel  
About you and me  
Now's a good time  
So go on and leave  
  
I've never been one for doing  
Something half the way  
I've loved you with all my heart  
But it's all been in vain  
  
It's gonna hurt  
Cut to the bone  
Break my heart in two  
When you move on  
I'm gonna cry a river of tears  
It's gonna rain and rain and rain  
'Round here for years  
  
I'm gonna cry a river of tears  
It's gonna rain  
Let the storm start  
If it's gonna rain I hope it pours

Nowhere to go, now that you're gone

And it seems like no matter how far I go  
Your memory just won't set me free

Keeps on remindin' me why you're gone

248,Bob Dylan,Days Of 49,/b/bob+dylan/days+of+49_20021516.html,"I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days  
They call me a bummer and a gin shot too, but what cares I for praise ?  
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign  
And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49""  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew  
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true  
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine  
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight  
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight  
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein  
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game  
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same  
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind  
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget  
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet  
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design  
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast  
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost  
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign  
""There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 ""  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.

One of you is all it takes to make my life complete

Treated like a stranger  
Living in her fantasies  
Trapped within their world  
  
Once upon a time  
Her hopes had died  
No one there to hear  
Her futile cries  
  
Living in a house of stone  
No one on her side  
Family in name alone  
No place left to hide

Once upon a time  
  
Once upon a dream  
A man will come  
And give her everything  
She wants and loves  
  
But in the morning  
She'll awake  
To face the room around her  
It's just another lonely day,  
  
And bitterness surrounds her  
Bitterness surrounds her  
Aah!

And every memory will bring you back  
  
Down this road there's a small white church  
Daddy lived his life by the preacher's word  
He raised me right, I could always feel his love  
Even when the angels called him home  
Down this road  
  
And it goes on forever  
And it goes by too fast  
It'll take you anywhere you want to go  
And every memory will bring you back  
  
Down this road  
Down this road  
Down this road

Waiting for a train,  
When I's feelin' as fadded as my jeans  
Bobby thumbed a diesel down  
Just before it rained  
It rode us all the way from New Orleans  
  
I pulled my harpoon out my dirty red bandanna  
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues  
Winsheild wipers slappin' time  
I's holdin' Bobby's hand in mine  
And we sang every song that driver knew  
  
Freedom's just another word  
For nothing left to loose  
Well nothing ain't nothing hun if it ain't free (da da)  
And feeling good was easy lord when he sang the blues  
Feeling good was good enough for me (da da)  
Good enough ffor me and my Bobby mcgee  
  
From the Kentucky cold mines  
To the California Sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul  
Through all kinds of weather,  
Through everything we'd done  
My Bobby, baby, kept me from the cold  
One day a misleading lord  
I let him slip away  
He's looking for that home  
And I hope he finds it  
Well I'd trade enough tomorrows for one single yesterday  
To be holding Bobby's body next to mine  
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to loose  
Now nothing, well that's all that Bobby left me  
Well feeling good was easy lord when he sang the blues  
Feeling good was good enough for me good enough for me mm hmm and my Bobby
mcgee la da da da da (ect) my Bobby Mcgee la da da da da ect  
Hey don't boss my Bobby mcgee  
Oh I call him my lover, I call him my man, I'll call him my lover, do the best

264,George Strait,Lone Star Blues,/g/george+strait/lone+star+blues_20980772.html,"At a truck stop in St Angelo  
Saw a bill board about this rodeo  
This weekend out in El Paso  
So I signed up to ride  
  
I drew a bull called ""original sin""  
Heard he'd killed a couple of men  
Figured this was something I could win  
'Cause the devil was on my side  
I was havin' myself one hell of a ride  
But I ended up disqualified  
That bull just up and died  
Before they blew the whistle  
  
[Chorus]  
With those north Texas blues,  
Thought I'd paid all my dues  
Then those south Texas blues,  
Told me ""son, you ain't through""  
Had the east Texas blues and the west Texas too  
I've done all I know to do,  
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose,  
These ol' Lone Star Blues.  
  
Well I got laid off at Brown and Rue  
Then on my way back to cuttin' chute  
I lost my wrist watch and my boots  
Shootin' dice with a dude from Houston  
Well there ain't no jobs here workin' cattle  
So I got on the part time haulin' gravel  
With some outfit from Seattle out here building custom homes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I gassed my truck and I packed my clothes  
Turned in my key and I hit the road  
I said ""cow town's where I'll go,  
You never know, I might get lucky!""  
  
Well I got a friend there turning knobs  
At a place called Billy Bobs  
Said thought he could get me a job there  
Workin' as a bouncer  
First night on the job was just insane  
Some ol' boy got all deranged  
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain  
To this day, my ears still ring!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've done all I know to do,  
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose

265,Bob Dylan,Caribbean Wind,/b/bob+dylan/caribbean+wind_20021635.html,"She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost  
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.  
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.  
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,  
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain  
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.  
  
Was she a child or a woman, I can't say which  
From one to another she could to easily switch  
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.  
Could I been used and played as a pawn?  
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on  
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore  
She said, ""We got a mutual friend over by the door,  
And you know he's got our best interest in mind.""  
He was well connected but her heart was a snare  
And she had left him to die in there,  
There were payments due and he was a little behind.  
  
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,  
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,  
Street band playing ""Nearer My God to Thee.""  
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,  
She said, ""I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing  
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea  
I hear a voice crying, ""Daddy,"" I always think it's for me,  
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.  
Every new messenger brings evil report  
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short  
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.  
  
Would I have married her? I don't know, I suppose.  
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes  
But I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin' on.  
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,  
I saw a house in the country being torn from within.  
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.

Can't forget about you. Can't forget about you.  
Breakin' my mind in three quarter time makin' me blue.

I still see your eyes, your warm, gentle smile.

Watchin' that old smokestack.  
Train is a-leavin' but it won't be back.  
  
Years ago we hang around,  
Watchin' trains roll through the town.  
Now that train is a-graveyard bound.  
  
Where we go up in that North country,  
Lakes and streams and mines so free,  
I had no better friend than he.  
  
Something happened to him that day,  
I thought I heard a stranger say,  
I hung my head and stole away.  
  
A diesel truck was headin' down,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
It left him on a Utah road.  
  
They carried him back to his home town,  
His mother cried, his sister moaned,  
Listenin' to them church bells tone.  
  
A diesel truck was rollin' slow,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
And it left him on a Utah road.

And shelters them  
In her coat of green

When little breezes call  
To ruffle up her skin  
All her sap runs free  
And sticks to me  
Hidden deep within

Why did you hide what you knew would not stay hidden  
How could you put yourself through like you did

Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents on the tree  
  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the lovelight gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams

That's what you get for lovin' me  
Ev'ry thing you had is gone  
As you can see  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
  
I ain't the kind to hang around  
With any new love that I found  
'Cause movin' is my stock in trade  
I'm movin' on  
I won't think of you when I'm gone.  
  
So don't you shed a tear for me  
Because I ain't the love you thought I'd be  
I got a hundred more like you  
So don't be blue  
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through  
  
Now there you go you're cryin' again  
Now there you go you're cryin' again  
But then someday when your poor heart  
Is on the mend  
Well I just might pass this way again  
  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
Everything you had is gone  
As you can see  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
That's what you get for lovin' me

I figure maybe we're even  
Or maybe I'm one up on you.  
  
I send you all my money  
Just like I did before.  
I tried to reach you honey,  
But you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore

I don't like playing cat and mouse.  
No gentleman likes making love to a servant.  
Especially when he's in his father's house.  
  
I never could guess your weight, baby,  
Never needed to call you my whore.  
I always thought you were straight, baby,  
But you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
Well these times and these tunnels are haunted,  
The bottom of the barrel is too.  
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted.  
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.  
  
Never no more do I wonder,  
Why you don't never play with me any more.  
At any moment you could go under,  
Cause you're driftin' too far from shore.  
  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
Driftin' too far from shore  
  
You and me we had completeness,  
I give you all of what I could provide  
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,  
We were the wrong side.  
  
I've already ripped out the phones, honey.  
You can't walk the streets in a war.  
I can finish this alone, honey,  
You're driftin' too far from shore.

In the lee of Christian Island  
  
Tall and strong she dips and reels  
I call her Silver Heels  
And she tells me how she feels  
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat  
Through the toughest gales and keep smiling  
But for one more day she would like to stay  
In the lee of Christian Island  
  
I'm sailing down the summer day  
Where fish and seagulls play  
I put my troubles all away  
And when the gale comes up I'll fill my cup  
With the whiskey of the highlands  
She's a good old ship and she'll make the trip  
From the lee of Christian Island  
  
Tall and strong she slips along  
I sing for her a song  
And she leans into the wind  
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat  
Through the toughest gales and keep smilin'

And it's all the precious cargo  
Of our fragile spaceship earth  
And it's countless voices cry on

Let us live  
The miracle is that they're here at all in the timeless night  
We are all fabric of life  
This miracle may never come again  
The planet is alive let it live  
Let us live  
In the roaring soaring cities  
In the mills and in the minds  
In the ice fields and the rice fields  
People work and live their lives  
And they strive to raise their children  
Hoping somehow they'll survive  
Is it all to much to ask for  
Let them live  
Let them live  
It's a thousand million light years  
To the farthest fringe of space  
And there may be nothing out there  
Even like the human race  
And we may be all alone then on our tiny island home  
And the planet is alive oh let it live  
Let it live

289,Gordon Lightfoot,Seven Island Suite,/g/gordon+lightfoot/seven+island+suite_20061676.html,"Seven islands to the high side of the bay, 'cross the bay  
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze  
We went walking on the high side of the bay on a chilly morn  
And we saw how leaves had fallen on the beds where trees were born  
Any man in his right mind could not fail to be made aware  
Any woman with a gift of wisdom would not seek her answers there  
  
Seven islands to the high side of the bay if you're looking west  
To the sunset you can see it, all in fiery autumn dress  
Anytime would be the right time to come up to your bed of boughs  
Anybody with a wish to wander could not fail but to be aroused  
  
Living high in the city, guess you think it's a pretty good way  
You get to learn but when you get burned you got nothing to say  
You seem to think because you got chicken to go you're in luck  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck  
Brothers will desert you when you're down and shit out of luck  
  
Look around at the morning, guess you're doing the best you can  
Surely you know that when you go nobody gives you a hand  
Think of the air you're breathing in, think of the time you waste  
Think of the right and wrong and consider the frown on your face  
  
It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest  
Any woman or a man with a wish to fade away could be so blessed  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion turned to gold  
Brothers will desert you when your nights turn long and cold  
  
If you feel it you better believe it, you're gonna see it, so you really  
know  
It is rising like a feather, dipping and dancing from below  
There's a new wave that is breaking in the wake of a passing ship  
Every nation's gonna be shaken, put it together, don't let it slip  
  
It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest  
Any man or a woman with a wish to fade away could be so blessed  
  
Seven islands to the high side of the bay, 'cross the bay  
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze  
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze

And the echo through the land.  
It's the voice of hope,  
It's the voice of peace,  
It's the voice of every man.  
From a distance, we all have enough,  
And no one is in need.  
And there are no guns, no bombs and no diseases,  
No hungry mouths to feed.  
From a distance, we are instruments,  
Matching in a common band,  
Playing songs of hope,  
Playing songs of peace,  
There is the song of every man.  
God is watching us, God is watching us,  
God is watching us, from a distance,  
Ohh God is watching us....... From a distance.  
From a distance, you look like my friend, even though we're at war.  
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend, what all this fighting is for?  
It's the hope of?, it's the love of all, it's the heart of every man.

We have soared above the clouds, we've heard the angels breathing  
While we made love in the morning, there was never talk of leaving

I was stone cold sober when I woke the morning after  
Having shattered the illusions of the object of my passions  
With a will made out of iron and a mind that is her own  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to her again  
We had it coming, had it going way back then  
  
I hope that we can see each other often  
That our points of view will blend into each other,

And the sun will shine upon us as we live our lives forever

With a blanket underneath his arm

Searching for the very souls  
Whom already have been sold.  
  
""Arise, arise"", he cried so loud  
With a voice without restraint  
""Come out ye gifted kings and queens  
And hear my sad complaint  
No martyr is among ye now  
Whom you can call your own  
So go on your way accordingly  
But know you're not alone"".

So alone and terrified  
I put my fingers against the glass  
And bowed my head and cried.

301,Gordon Lightfoot,Long Thin Dawn,/g/gordon+lightfoot/long+thin+dawn_20061514.html,"That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
I've seen the hills of Frisco and the streets of Montreal  
In every town I've been to I've had someone to call  
From Winnipeg to Edmonton, Vancouver to St. Paul  
I've had so many good friends I couldn't miss them all  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Last night I came to Denver beneath the snowcapped ridge  
I thought about my darling as I stood beneath the bridge  
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now she's learned  
That any time I've wandered I always have returned  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Right now I'm on a highway just east of Omaha  
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw  
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill  
All the way to Windsor, we've got some miles to kill  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
While climbing up a hillside, Bill drops her down a gear  
And the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear  
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can  
Driving like the restless wind across this precious land  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Says Bill, ""The air is clean tonight"", as he puffs a big cigar  
""And if this rig keeps rolling, my boy you'll travel far  
But when you are a trucker you'll come to realize  
The only thing a man can do is watch the world go by""  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again

Looking far off into the east  
And I see my baby comin'  
She's walking with the village beast  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the last part of the day's already gone  
  
We got so much in common  
We strive for the same old ends  
And I just can't wait  
Wait for us to become friends  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone

And they say that love is blind  
If you wanna live easy  
Baby, pack your clothes with mine  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well now what's the use in dreaming  
You got better things to do  
Dreams never did work for me anyway  
Even when they did come true  
  
You are as porous as ever  
Baby you can start a fire  
I must be losing my mind  
You're the object of my desire  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver  
And I'm reading James Joyce  
Some people they tell me  
I got the blood of the land in my voice  
  
Everybody got all the money  
Everybody got all the beautiful clothes  
Everybody got all the flowers  
I don't have one single rose  
I feel a change comin' on

303,Alabama,The Refrain Of John Dillon James,/a/alabama/the+refrain+of+john+dillon+james_20715291.html,"  
Oh, John Dillon James was my good time country buddy  
Well, we hunted, talked and fished his last days away  
He was just a hired farm hand, worked old man Walker's land  
Retired on his 68th birthday  
Yeah, he wore a size sixteen shoe, had skin like alligator  
Lord, he could pick up a deer and walk right out of those woods  
Old Dillon had a million tales but he sung me one refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
One July Monday morning I met him at the fishing hole  
But old Dillon wasn't toting his half pint of tin hide  
His roll your own tobacco string was a-hanging from his pocket  
His eyes were red as beets, looked like he cried  
And I know he sat on knees cause his overalls were muddy  
But my ten year old mind didn't understand  
He sat down on the bank and wrote this four line refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly  
Paid the price down on my knees  
A voice from heaven promised me  
I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
  
Well, it was one year to the day on a July Monday morning  
I waited at the fishing hole but old Dillon, he didn't show  
Daddy came down about noon, and said  
Son, I've got some news  
Lord's rested old Dillon's soul  
Yeah, and I walked up to his bedside  
Looked down at old big Dillon  
Lord knows that I saw a pair of wings  
That tables set but I felt good, for at last I understood  
That refrain sung by John Dillon James  
  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky, Lord, y'all  
I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly)  
I paid the price down on my knees  
A voice from heaven promised me  
Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
Yeah, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky

A careful step through broken glass, yeah  
One thoughtless word could kill a memory  
And days we loved together in the past  
  
I give and take i do my very best  
To keep this vision that i've seen  
I give respect if you could just accept  
There never really was a perfect me

And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
You walk away and see yourself in retrospect  
Remember all of love's first visions  
Step aside try to see just what went wrong  
Living together isn't easy all the time  
  
I believe in you if you believe in me, oh  
There's still the chance that we can find romance, yeah  
I know we can

Once again she's leaving, but Lord, she's not to blame  
This morning a memory phoned her and he's a habit she can't break  
So 'til she returns, I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
The devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know she's hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything  
But I love her, so I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
I'll pick up the pieces when he lets her down again  
With love and understanding, I'll give her reasons this time to stay  
And I'll close my eyes pretending maybe someday she will change  
And I won't be left lonely,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
Yes, the devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything

Precious father and loving mother  
Fly across the lonely years  
And old home scenes of my childhood  
In fond memories appear  
  
As I travel on life's pathway  
Know not what the years may hold  
As I ponder, hope grows fonder  
Precious memories flood my soul  
  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Echo's from the past I hear  
Old time singing, gladness bringing  
From that lovely land somewhere  
  
Precious memories, how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred seems unfold

Worrying 'bout the daily grind  
But life's a journey, no need to hurry  
It's one day at a time

Take one step then take another  
Keep on walkin', we're headed in the right direction  
Puttin' one foot in front of the other

Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other  
  
What's down the road we can't say  
And the road behind don't matter  
But every mile along the way  
Is just another mile together  
Unconcerned about the twists and turns  
We're takin' it nice and slow  
Safe and sound, covering ground  
Steady as she goes

Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow takes care of itself  
We'll just keep on keepin' on  
'Cause we ain't stumbled yet  
  
One foot in front of the other  
Take one step and then take another  
Just a-walkin' and a-talkin' and a-movin' in the same direction  
Just puttin' one foot in front of the other

And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,  
Don't put on any airs when you're down on rue morgue avenue,  
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outa you!  
  
Sweet melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of doom,  
She speaks good english and she invites you up into her room.  
And you're so kind, too careful not to go to her too soon,  
Then she steals your voice and leaves you howling at the moon!  
  
Up on housing project hill it's either fortune or fame,  
You must pick one or the other though neither of them is what they claim,  
If you're lookin' to get silly you'd better go back to from where you came,  
Because the cops don't need you and man they expect the same!  
  
I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff,  
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,  
But the joke was on me - there was nobody there to even call my bluff,

Until you have played the game  
Till you live life in solitaire where  
No one knows your name  
I'd rather press on, I don't want to rest easy  
Have it anyway you will  
I will be with you right up until  
The spell is broken and all is well  
If you'd rather be by the seashore  
Well, I sure can understand  
Are you too wrapped up in your own scene  
I would change things if I can  
I'd rather press on, don't want to rest easy

And all of the good times makes me blue

Was always spreading comfort hope and cheer

And she will be at rest with Him above  
And some glad morning she I know will welcome me  
To that eternal home of peace and love

The Carolina lady waits for her man from Tennessee  
Somewhere in a motel...... Out in Oklahoma  
There's the Alabama dreamer  
That same man from Tennessee  
  
Sometime late at night...... The lonely wakes her gently  
And knocks at her door...... But she won't give in  
But like every other woman........ She needs to feel wanted  
She thinks of making love....... And goes to sleep again  
  
Carolina......... Dreamin' lonely  
Carolina......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady.....  
That I dream of holding tight.....  
That I kiss and tell goodnight.....  
Carolina....... Mountain dewe  
  
Sometime that next day..... On a Mississippi freeway  
The Alabama dreamer........ Is homeward bound  
His conscious is as clear........ As those green eyes of Carolina  
And she's waiting with the baby from the love.............. Of the only man to  
Lay her down  
  
Carolina.......... Dreaming lonely  
Carolina.......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady  
That I dream of holding tight  
That I kiss and tell goodnight  
Carolina...... Mountain dewe  
Carolina.......... I love you

Burn one for me when you get time

Paper matches in the afternoon  
Cups of tea and all of that Zen  
I think, it's time we took a walk outside  
It seems there is no oxygen  
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone  
I believe, it's best we carry on  
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear  
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust  
When we get back where we belong  
If you ever turn that page again  
You need a friend, if you ask me, I'll tag along

To find romance  
While dancers dance so close  
Deep inside to our dream of dreams

Yes I'm falling watch me falling  
Something warm is turning inside of me  
Something warm is burning inside of me

325,Bob Dylan,Ain't Talkin',/b/bob+dylan/aint+talkin_20538895.html,"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden  
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine  
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain  
Someone hit me from behind  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through this weary world of woe  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
No one on earth would ever know  
  
They say prayer has the power to heal  
So pray from the mother  
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell  
I am a-tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others  
But oh, mother, things ain't going well  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost  
  
Now I'm all worn down by weeping  
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry  
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping  
I'll just slaughter 'em where they lie  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through the world mysterious and vague  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' through the cities of the plague.  
  
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation  
The whole wide world which people say is round  
They will tear your mind away from contemplation  
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Eatin' hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Some day you'll be glad to have me around.  
  
They will crush you with wealth and power  
Every waking moment you could crack  
I'll make the most of one last extra hour  
I'll revenge my father's death then I'll step back  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Hand me down my walkin' cane.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Got to get you out of my miserable brain.  
  
All my loyal and my much-loved companions  
They approve of me and share my code  
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned  
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.  
  
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'  
Fame and honor never seem to fade  
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'  
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Carryin' a dead man's shield  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel  
  
The sufferin' is unending  
Every nook and cranny has its tears  
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending  
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Walkin' ever since the other night.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' 'til I'm clean out of sight.  
  
As I walked out in the mystic garden  
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn  
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon  
There's no one here, the gardener is gone  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Up the road, around the bend.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
In the last outback at the world's end.

There's got to be a way that I can dream  
Simply close my eyes and see  
The worlds I've never known  
What places that my soul has been  
  
Sometimes I need to run away and hide  
I sail along so high  
Till nothing's in my sky  
Except the stars that fill my eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm searching for the one who holds the key  
To all this crazy life I lead  
Through galaxies in time  
A solitary star that joins  
  
Sometimes I need to close my eyes and breathe  
Inhale what life has given me  
A bastion to ignite  
A flaming heart in flight  
I close my eyes  
I breathe  
I'm free  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I've always must have known  
A lover of his own  
'Cause that is when he wrote  
Everything I felt for love  
  
And I will fight for love in life and in love  
And I will hold the things above  
I'm strong enough to slay the dragon that's there  
I will live for love  
  
I've thought about this life  
This dream will never die  
So only know that I  
I will live for love  
  
Always must have known a lover of his own  
That is when he wrote everything I felt for love  
I will ever fight  
I will live for life  
I will live for love

Stayed away from love  
Afraid of what might  
Might happen  
Till I thought  
I heard a sound above  
Singing through my very  
Own heart  
Was a melody  
I never heard  
Like birds singing loud  
To the sky  
  
Never dreamed that  
True love would help me  
Find my way  
Didn't know how deep I'd fallen  
Until you rescued, rescued me  
Suddenly  
Strings began  
I heard the melody again and again  
The sound of music  
Flowing through my head  
So rare  
I'm walking on air  
  
Melody of love  
Sing that song for me yeah  
I want to hear somebody sing  
Melody of love  
Oh take me away  
  
One lonely night  
You up and dance into my dreams  
Baby you set my heart on fire  
So I've been burning  
Burning ever since yeah  
Suddenly  
Strings began  
I hear the melody again and again  
The sounds of trumpets  
Flowing through my head  
So rare I'm walking on air

Sing that song for me yeah  
I want to hear somebody sing

Oh melody  
Oh melody  
I can really feel it  
You can feel it, too  
Oh melody

I've listened to nothing that life had to tell me,  
Watched all my dreams rise and fall.  
I've made my mistakes, but it's not too late to pull myself out of the blues.  
Its took me some time but I've made up my mind, I'm hanging up my travelin

They cut George Jackson down.

They laid him in the ground.

For a seventy-dollar robbery.  
Closed the door behind him  
And they threw away the key.  
Lord, Lord, They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.

He wouldn't bow down or kneel.  
Authorities, they hated him  
Because he was just too real.

They cut George Jackson down.

They were scared of his love.

And who lies with ev'ry breath,  
Who passionately hates his life  
And likewise, fears his death.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Whose strength is spent in vain,  
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,  
Whose tears are like rain,  
Who eats but is not satisfied,  
Who hears but does not see,  
Who falls in love with wealth itself  
And turns his back on me.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Who tramples through the mud,  
Who fills his mouth with laughing  
And who builds his town with blood,  
Whose visions in the final end  
Must shatter like the glass.  
I pity the poor immigrant  
When his gladness comes to pass.

For the things that might have been  
I need no more reminders  
Not one love letter have I seen  
And that's a pretty good start

Float me out of danger until then  
Forever amen

We'll be leavin' early travelin' light  
That's alright heaven will be ours tonight  
The road is paved with moonbeams  
There are faces that I knew  
They all came back to haunt me  
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you  
It takes a bit of my heart  
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore  
Sea of dreams from now on  
Forget about all the others  
Back where the line forms  
Destination sea of storms  
By all means ever onward sea of dreams  
Put me somewhere east of midnight  
Along about daylight  
Anywhere I wander  
Is where I'll take my rest

All up and down this country at labor I did toil  
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun  
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run  
  
When first I did come down where the land meets the sea  
The people said Who are you and what would your name be  
I said I have no home and I am no man's son  
'Twas inland I was born and from inland that I come  
  
In the good land I was young and I was strong  
No one dared to call me son  
Happy just to see my day's work done  
See my day's work done  
  
So I swung an axe as a timberjack  
And I worked the Quebec mines  
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines  
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town  
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds  
  
I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too  
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew  
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing  
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring  
  
In the good land I was young and I was strong  
No one dared to call me son  
Happy just to see my day's work done  
See my day's work done  
  
But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide  
The old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide  
And the legacy I'm leavin' you is not very hard to find  
You'll see it all around you at this crossroads of time  
In the sweet soil it's a-growin' At the crossroads of time

355,Gordon Lightfoot,Drifters,/g/gordon+lightfoot/drifters_20061501.html,"I don't believe in miracles if it's all the same by you  
Your wishes would come true if I had my say  
Whether it's right or wrong, the words of every song  
Remind us of a love we knew  
Where love should not go wrong, in yesterdays  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got so much to go and gamble on  
Watch out for the shifting sand  
Where ever you may ramble  
Even now, as I look back and see all that's come to pass  
I can't remember how it was I got here  
Look around this place, there's a smile on every face  
We're somewhere in the afterglow, out there among the stars  
Out there among the bars  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got places to go and people to meet  
Watch out for the shifting tide  
Where ever you may travel  
I know I should not complain because life's been good to me  
It feels real good to be stranded on my own  
Be that as it may be, we are what we are  
I'll find you in the afterglow out there among the stars  
Of yesteryear  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got so much to go and gamble on  
Watch out for the shifting sand  
Where ever you may ramble  
All you drifters now  
You got places to go and people to meet  
Watch out for the shifting tide  
Where ever you may travel

356,George Strait,Lovebug,/g/george+strait/lovebug_20059454.html,"Well I was ruling the roost, had all the chicks to myself.  
And suddenly it happened, that funny little feeling I felt.  
Well I tried to outrun it, but it finally caught up with me.  
Tell me how can I run from something that I can't see?  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
  
Well I always thought that I had me a pretty good style,  
But I lost that race by a good old country mile.  
Well I was walking all around with my head held way up high,  
And it fooled me, hit me, really took me by surprise.  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.

357,Bob Dylan,Billy 1,/b/bob+dylan/billy+1_20021482.html,"There's guns across the river aimin' at ya  
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya  
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya  
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.  
  
Campin' out all night on the berenda  
Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the hacienda  
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya  
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.  
  
Playin' around with some sweet senorita  
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya  
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya  
Billy, you're so far away from home.  
  
There's eyes behind the mirrors in empty places  
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces  
There's always one more notch and ten more paces  
Billy, and you're walkin' all alone.  
  
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number  
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber  
Every little sound just might be thunder  
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.  
  
Guitars will play your grand finale  
Down in some Tularosa alley,  
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley  
Billy, you're so far away from home.  
  
There's always some new stranger sneakin' glances  
Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances  
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances  
Advances on your spirit and your soul.  
  
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down  
They've hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown.  
Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down  
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?  
  
Hang on to your woman if you got one  
Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one.  
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one  
Billy, you been runnin' for so long.  
  
Guitars will play your grand finale  
Down in some Tularosa alley  
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley  
Billy, you're so far away from home.

358,Bob Dylan,2 X 2,/b/bob+dylan/2+x+2_20021623.html,"One by one, they followed the sun,  
One by one, until there were none.  
Two by two, to their lovers they flew,  
Two by two, into the foggy dew.  
Three by three, they danced on the sea,  
Four by four, they danced on the shore,  
Five by five, they tried to survive,  
Six by six, they were playing with tricks.  
  
How many paths did they try and fail?  
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?  
How much poison did they inhale?  
How many black cats crossed their trail?  
Seven by seven, they headed for heaven,  
Eight by eight, they got to the gate,  
Nine by nine, they drank the wine,  
Ten by ten, they drank again.  
  
How many tomorrow's have are they given away?  
How many compared to yesterday?  
How many more without any reward?  
How many more can they afford?  
Two by two, they stepped into the ark,  
Two by two, they step in the dark.  
Three by three, they're turning the key,  
Four by four, they turn it some more,  
One by one, they follow the sun,  
Two by two, to another rendezvous.

359,Gordon Lightfoot,Station Master,/g/gordon+lightfoot/station+master_20061711.html,"In the dawn's early light  
From a long and a sleepless night  
She returned again this morning  
From her long and restless flight  
And my red hollow eyes  
Did not show her much surprise  
As she lay right down beside me  
Like she never said goodbye  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
It was all I could bear  
Just to watch her lying there  
Disowned and ragged princess  
With the sun locked in her hair  
So cold, so frail  
With her mind locked in a jail  
The victim of confusion  
Never knowing she could fail  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
So I rocked her to sleep  
Then I got up on my feet  
And the day was filled with sunshine  
As I gazed across the street  
And the door seemed to say  
Over here, step this way  
The station is for travelers  
Even you must ride someday  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
Please help me station master  
Can I stay for just a while?  
Forgive me if I'm weary  
I ain't had much, much time to smile

Acting so strange  
If something's wrong  
Don't drag it on  
  
'Cause each time I phone  
You're never home  
Each time we meet out on the street  
You hardly speak  
  
Ooh baby something's in the wind  
Ooh baby are we near the end  
I know baby something's in the wind  
So why pretend  
  
Ooh baby something's in the wind  
Ooh baby tell me what it is  
Something baby is blowing in the wind  
Out in the wind  
  
Nothing has changed  
That's what you say  
So how come each date  
You turn up late  
  
You say I'm wrong  
Your love's still strong  
So how come each kiss  
Means less and less  
  
Ooh baby something's in the wind  
Ooh baby are we near the end  
I know baby something's in the wind  
So why pretend  
  
Ooh baby something's in the wind  
Ooh baby tell me what it is  
Something's baby is blowing in the wind  
Out in the wind

Every time you throw dirt on her

362,Gordon Lightfoot,Can't Depend On Love,/g/gordon+lightfoot/cant+depend+on+love_20061609.html,"I spent most of my life outside, in the driving rain  
I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities  
Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for  
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me  
It took most of my time to do what never was done  
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone  
Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way  
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you  
I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain  
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane  
To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price  
Well, ain't that nice, knowing I'm so free?  
I can't depend on love to defend me  
I got more than I bargained for  
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me

Most anywhere you go,  
And his holdings are in Texas  
And his name is Diamond Joe.  
  
And he carries all his money  
In a diamond-studded jar.  
He never took much trouble  
With the process of the law.  
  
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,  
Did offer him my hand,  
He gave a string of horses  
So old they could not stand.  
  
And I nearly starved to death, boys,  
He did mistreat me so,  
And I never saved a dollar  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
Now his bread it was corn dodger  
And his meat you couldn't chaw,  
Nearly drove me crazy  
With the wagging of his jaw.  
  
And the telling of his story,  
Mean to let you know  
That there never was a rounder  
That could lie like Diamond Joe.  
  
Now, I tried three times to quit him,  
But he did argue so  
I'm still punching cattle  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
And when I'm called up yonder  
And it's my time to go,  
Give my blankets to my buddies  
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

Cursin' the dead that can't answer him back

Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his business-like anger and bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.

Will this be the change you need to show you who you are  
I love you but I'll leave you just to prove you've gone too far

There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow  
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea  
When will you love me  
As I love thee  
  
I have no gold to give her  
Nor gowns of soft crimson hue  
Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her  
Into my heart so strong so true  
When will you love me  
As I love you  
  
Beyond the wild misty mountain  
Within the valley so free  
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow  
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea  
When will you love me  
As I love thee

So let's share the rest, of the tears that are left  
From two hearts that just came undone  
Why should we go crazy alone

Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong.  
Just a little glimpse of a story I'll tell  
'Bout an east coast city that you all know well.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Old new york city is a friendly old town,  
From Washington heights to Harlem on down.  
There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,  
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate  
To Rockefeller plaza n' the Empire State.  
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,  
Old mister empire never says a word.  
  
It's hard times from the country,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.  
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.  
If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,  
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten island ferry.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream  
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream.  
Bought your city on a one-way track,  
If I had my way I'd sell it right back.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
I'll take all the smog in California  
'N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,  
'N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines.  
It's all much cleaner than the New York kind.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
So all you newsy people, spreadin' the news around,  
You see'n listen to m' story, listen to m' song.  
You see'n step on my name, you see'n try 'n' get me beat,  
When I leave New York, I'll be standin' on my feet.  
  
Hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.

Echoing for more  
Voices cryin' out  
Voices cryin' out  
Voices cryin' out...

372,Bob Dylan,Floater,/b/bob+dylan/floater_10043295.html,"Down over the window  
From the dazzling sunlit rays  
Through the back alleys, through the blinds  
Another one of them endless days  
  
Honey bees are buzzing  
Leaves begin to stir  
I'm in love with my second cousin  
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her  
  
I keep listening for footsteps  
But I ain't never hearing any  
From the boat, I fish for bullheads  
I catch a lot, sometimes too many  
  
A summer breeze is blowin'  
A squall is setting in  
Sometimes it's just plain stupid  
To get into any kind of wind  
  
Well the old men 'round here  
Sometimes they get on bad terms  
With the younger men,  
Old, young, age don't carry weight  
It doesn't matter in the end  
  
One of the boss' hangers-on  
Sometimes comes to call  
At times you least expect  
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,  
Inspire you with fear  
It has the opposite effect  
  
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town  
The old one is long gone  
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across  
Burns with the bark still on  
  
They say times are hard  
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose  
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere  
We'll just have to see how it goes  
  
My old man, he's like some feudal lord  
He's got more lives than a cat  
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once  
Things come alive or they fall flat  
  
You can smell the pine wood burnin'  
You can hear the school bell ring  
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can  
If you wanna learn anything  
  
Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion  
It don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch  
Juliet said back to Romeo,  
Why don't you just shove off,  
If it bothers you so much  
  
They got outta here any way they could  
Cold rain can give you the shivers  
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,  
All the rest of them rebel rivers  
  
If you ever try to interfere with me  
Or cross my path again,  
You do so at the peril of your life  
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound  
I've seen enough heartache and strife  
  
My grandfather was a duck trapper,  
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes [?]  
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,  
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.  
  
I had 'em once, though I suppose  
To go along with all the ring dancing,  
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves  
I left all my dreams and hopes  
Buried under tobacco leaves  
  
Not always easy kicking someone up  
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task  
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up  
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.

An' be politically incorrect.  
Show off that red 'round your neck:  
Not hear a single soul object.  
Wouldn't need no lawyers to decide,  
Who is wrong and who is right.  
No need for big expensive trials:

Just set a tip jar in the back.  
If we ran low, we'd pass the hat:  
I bet we'd all be in the black,  
If the whole world was a honky-tonk.  
  
And if you're lookin' love:  
Someone to heal that broken heart.  
Hey, buddy, you'd be in half.  
You wouldn't have to go that far.

And the king would be George Jones,

I think I'd like to greet her  
And thank her for the favors that she gave  
A stranger I came  
My head bowed in the rain to her door

Buyin' kingdoms with my songs  
Knowin' I'd be back in just a while  
Warm in the sunlight of her smile

I catch myself just looking back  
Reliving all the wonder of those nights

Bring me to meet your sound  
And I will bring you to my heart  
  
Love, like a signal you call  
Touching my body, my soul  
Bring to me, you to meet me here  
  
Home, be the temple of your heart  
Home, be the body of your love  
Just like holy water to my lips  
(Hey, hey)  
  
Yes, I do know how I survive  
Yes, I do know why I'm alive  
To love and be with you  
Day by day by day by day  
  
Time, time again, it is said  
We will hear, we will see  
See it all in his wisdom hear  
  
His truth will abound the land  
This truth will abound the land  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
  
Say, yeah-e-yay, yeah-e-yo  
Yeah-e-yay, yeah-e-yo  
Be the sound of higher love today  
Yeah-e-yeah (hey, hey)  
  
Time, time again, it is said  
We will hear, we will see  
See it all in his wisdom hear  
  
His truth will abound the land  
This truth will abound the land  
This state of independence shall be

Don't lose it girl it's got to be  
The one creative thing that's left for you and me  
If you find it  
Don't lose it all the very next day  
Lock it in your soul and throw the key away  
  
So, don't you let it go  
Let it stay let it grow  
Like the snow  
Don't let it melt away  
If you find it  
Then give it girl with all your might  
Forget about yourself you're not the losin' kind  
  
If you get it  
Then keep it cool don't let it die  
You may only see it once don't let it pass you by  
So don't you let it go  
Let it stay let it grow

393,Alabama,Patches,/a/alabama/patches_20522142.html,"(Spoken)  
I was born and raised down in Alabama  
On a farm way back up in the woods  
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches  
Papa used to tease me about it  
Of course deep down inside he was hurt  
'Cause he done all he could  
  
(Sang)  
Papa was a great old man  
I can see him with a shovel in his hand  
See, education he never had  
He did wonders when the time got bad  
The little money from the crops he raised  
Barely paid the bills he made  
So life had kicked him down to the ground  
When he tried to get up  
Life would kick him back down  
One day papa called me to his dyin bed  
Put his hands on my shoulders  
Then with a tears he said  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Two days later papa passed away  
And I became a man that day  
So I told mama I was gonna quit school  
She said that was daddy's strictest rule  
  
(Sang)  
So every morning 'fore I went to school  
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too  
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on  
I wanted to leave just run away from home  
But I always remembered what my daddy said  
With tears in his eyes on his dyin bed  
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you  
  
(Spoken)  
Then one day a strong rain came  
And washed all the crops away  
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying  
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders  
But you know, mama she knew what I was going through,  
  
(Sang)  
Everyday I had to work the fields  
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals  
You see, I was the oldest of a family  
And everybody else depended on me  
Every night I heard my mama pray  
Lord, give him the strength to make another day  
Though years have passed and all the kids are grown  
And amgels took my mama to a brand new home  
Lord knows people that I she'd a tear  
My daddy's voice kept a-tinging in my ears  
Sayin, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son, it's all left up to you...  
  
Patches, I'm depending on you son  
I'm depending on you son  
To pull the family through

Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, let me thank you for your time

I remember the time at the old mill pond  
When I would've drowned beyond doubt  
But old Shep was right there, to the rescue he came  
He jumped in and helped pull me out  
  
As, the years passed and rolled, at last he grew old  
And his eyesight was fast growing dim.  
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said  
I can't do no more for him, Jim?  
  
I went to his side and sat on the ground  
And laid his old head on my knee  
Well, he was the best friend that I ever had  
I cried so I scarcely could see  
  
Old Sheppie he knew, he was going to go  
For he reached out and licked at my hand  
He looked up at me, just as much as to say  
We're parting but you understand  
  
Now old Sheppie is gone where the good doggies go  
And no more with old Shep will I roam  
But if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing for sure  
Old Shep has a wonderful home

Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,  
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,  
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.  
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

I heard the drifter say,  
As they carried him from the courtroom  
And were taking him away.  
""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one  
And my time it isn't long,  
And I still do not know  
What it was that I've done wrong.""  
  
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,  
A tear came to his eye,  
""You fail to understand,"" he said,  
""Why must you even try?""  
Outside, the crowd was stirring,  
You could hear it from the door.  
Inside, the judge was stepping down,  
While the jury cried for more.  
  
""Oh, stop that cursed jury,""  
Cried the attendant and the nurse,  
""The trial was bad enough,  
But this is ten times worse.""  
Just then a bolt of lightning  
Struck the courthouse out of shape,  
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray  
The drifter did escape.

407,Donna Summer,Sand On My Feet,/d/donna+summer/sand+on+my+feet_20832504.html,"Wakin' up this morning  
Saw the sun come through my blinds  
And I looked up on the porch  
And found an owl shrieking by  
But never could I have imagined  
Such a place like this  
And you're lyin' next to me  
I wanna wake you with a kiss  
  
And all the crazy things about you  
That I so adore  
Are the little things that keep me  
Coming back for more  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
I will go wherever you go  
Take me where you lead  
Lead me where you want  
My heart doesn't know  
Anything but what you say  
You're the one for me  
You make me feel complete  
  
I can silent read your whisper  
And my lips still feel your touch  
And I'm oh so glad to be here  
Oh so glad to be here  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
But you and I have walked the oceans  
Miles along the shore  
And a thousand seagulls called on me  
So we came right back for more  
And I love to feel the water  
It makes me feel so free  
Underneath the purple sky  
Every time you look at me  
  
I reach up to forever  
With the promises you keep  
They fill me with such happiness  
It makes my heart believe  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
How many lovers  
Have walked along the shore before  
Before you and I  
How many said goodbye

Sounds of laughter on faces gray  
Yesterday's a carousel  
Catch the ring and all will be well  
From the coast of California  
Up to the Oregon border  
I've thumbed a thousand miles I guess  
Sitting in a roadside diner  
The big trucks rollin' by  
I don't seem to know at times what's best  
And still I'd like to tell her  
That I miss her so, in north Ontario  
If you're drivin' east to Reno  
Or north to Mendocino  
I hope you find your rainbow?s end  
This highway is my rainbow  
And though I might regret it  
I'm so glad I said it way back when  
And still I'd like to tell her  
That I miss her so, in north Ontario

We had patches on our britches but momma kept us neat

We picked the cotton and gathered the corn  
We were taught to work from the day we were born

415,Donna Summer,(Theme) Once Upon A Time,/d/donna+summer/theme+once+upon+a+time_20506811.html,"(Voice monologue over ""Once Upon A Time"" instrumental)  
  
Once upon a time, there was a girl  
She lived in the land of never-never  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on, because she believed  
That once, once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time, in the land of never-never  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

Could it be that I'm the fool?

And the waves overlap  
When I've called in the cat  
She'll go walkin'  
And she cries to herself  
In the night when I'm asleep  
She lies awake and weeps  
Could it be something new  
Some one old who has returned?  
Or is it just a game?  
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me

426,Gordon Lightfoot,Summer Side Of Life,/g/gordon+lightfoot/summer+side+of+life_20061649.html,"He came down through fields of green  
On the summer side of life  
His love was ripe  
  
There was no illusions  
On the summer side of life  
Only tenderness  
  
And if you saw him now  
You'd wonder why he would cry  
The whole day long  
  
There was young girls everywhere  
On the summer side of life  
They talked all night  
  
To the young men that they knew  
On the summer side of life  
Goin' off to fight  
  
And if you saw them now  
You'd wonder why they would cry  
The whole day long  
  
He came down through fields of green  
On the summer side of life  
He prayed all night  
  
Then he walked into a house  
Where love had been misplaced  
His chance to waste  
  
And if you saw him now  
You'd wonder why he would cry  
The whole day long  
  
And if you saw him now  
You'd wonder why  
And if you saw him now  
You'd wonder why

A car rolls up outside on time, a moment from your call  
And handshake seems more fitting than a kiss  
Such a shame that you and I should have to end like this  
  
Can't we just sit down and talk it over  
Surely you can ask the better way  
Strange that you're the one so set on leaving  
And I'm the one who said last night that it was all too late  
  
Can't we just sit down and talk it over  
Who knows, maybe in a little while  
We'll forget our pride, and the things we said last night  
And maybe you and I can talk it out  
  
Tonight stay somewhere warm, they say it's gonna freeze  
You may not find a place at all, so be sure and take your keys  
I can almost taste the silence now  
Does it really matter still,  
Who was wrong, who let who down  
  
Can't we just sit down and talk it over  
Who knows, maybe in a little while  
We'll forget our pride, and the things we said last night  
And maybe you and I can talk it out  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Surely you and I can talk it out  
Hold on, hold on  
Surely you and I can make it right  
Hold on, hold on, yeah  
Can't we just sit down and talk it over  
Hold on, hold on

You're a feeling I haven't forgot, the love I can't unlearn.  
You've become a memory I can't live without.  
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know how to handle the dream you left behind.  
It's like a lighted candle burning up my mind.  
At least I'm happy knowing what love is all about.  
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.  
  
Embers to ashes, that's how it should be.  
You'd think by now my heart would know, and it could set you free.  
The things I've tried, the tears I've cried, I guess there's no doubt  
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.

Said you couldn't feel it anymore  
Those words that rolled off your tongue  
Tore my world in two  
As you turned and walked on out the door  
I've been trying to get over you  
And get on with my life  
But the more I do without you  
The more I realize  
  
I can't love you any less, no matter how I try  
You left me with a feeling, that just won't seem to die  
And it's killing me knowing, I'll never hold you like before  
I don't love you any less

Well girl I hope you never feel  
The way I feel tonight  
It's a hopeless kind of pain  
Well I'm not even comin' close  
To gettin' over you  
Feels like it's never gonna end  
So why do I keep hangin' on  
And wastin' my time  
Wish I could let you go  
But this old heart of mine  
  
Can't love you any less, no matter how I try  
You left me with a feeling, that just won't seem to die  
And it's killing me knowing, I'll never hold you like before

And the sun is a-goin' down upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son  
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one  
For the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep  
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who will judge the many when the game is through?  
Ring them bells for the time that flies  
For the child who cries when innocence dies  
Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the roof  
Ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom  
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong  
And they're breakin' down the distance between right and wrong

Wise men from de east came to Jerusalem and asked  
""where is the one who is born king of the Jews?  
We saw his star in the east and we have come to worship him""  
  
Lord we have traveled far  
Torn and weary guided by your star  
There before us the living king  
Hallelujah his praises sing  
  
Herod with a evil plan  
Kill the babies  
Came his bold command  
He tried to alter god's holy plan  
God has saved him  
The son of man  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god  
  
Three kings from a distance come  
Bearing gifts for the only one  
Shout to heaven sound the drum  
Tell the nations  
The lord has come  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god

He came to bring us his joy  
To bring us love

When Jesus Christ was born

442,Gordon Lightfoot,Long River,/g/gordon+lightfoot/long+river_20061599.html,"Where the long river flows  
It flows by my window  
Where the tall timber grows  
It grows 'round my door  
Where the mountains meet the sky  
And the white clouds fly  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
  
There's a tiny bird that calls  
And he calls by my window  
There's a lonely tear that falls  
And it falls 'round my door  
But when the sun is high  
There's no time to cry  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
  
Now if only you could see  
The closin' of the day  
If only you could be  
Where the dawn breaks away  
By the white cascade  
Oh down in the glade  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
  
Well when this land was made  
It was made full of wonder  
But one woman's love  
I can't understand  
And I'd give it all to you  
If her love were true  
Where the long river flows  
By my window  
Where the long river flows  
By my window

She's all in her tender years.  
She fell in love with a sailor boy,  
It's true she loved him well.  
For to go off to sea with him  
Like she did not know how,  
She longed to see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
So she bargained with the sailor boy,  
All for a piece of gold.  
Straightaway then he led her  
Down into the hold,  
Sayin', ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,  
Your jacket shall be blue.  
You'll see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the other sailors heard the news,  
Well, they fell into a rage,  
And with all the ship's company  
They were willing to engage.  
Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,  
Overboard we'll throw her.  
She'll never see that seaport town  
Called Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the captain he heard the news,  
Well, he too fell in a rage,  
And with the whole ship's company  
He was willing to engage,  
Sayin', ""She'll stay in sailor's clothes,  
Her color shall be blue,  
She'll see that seaport town  
Call Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when they come down to Canada  
Scarcely 'bout half a year,  
She's married this bold captain  
Who called her his dear.  
She's dressed in silks and satins now,  
She cuts a gallant show,  
Finest of the ladies  
Down Canadee-i-o.  
  
Come, all you fair and tender girls,  
Wheresoever you may be,  
I'd have you to follow your own true love  
Whene'er he goes to sea.  
For if the sailors prove false to you,  
Well, the captain, he might prove true.  
You'll see the honor I have gained  
By the wearing of the blue.

Something else just hit the ground

I'd even dance a jig on the ground.

Everybody gets their time,  
Little David when he picked up his pebbles,  
Even Sampson after he went blind.  
Well, everybody gets the chance  
To do what they want to do.

Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle,  
You made me to a walkin' wreck,  
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone,  
Then you knocked off my head from my neck.  
Well, if I'm ever standin' steady  
A-doin' what I want to do,  
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
I'm just restin' at your gate so that I won't be late  
And, momma, I'm a-just sittin' on the shelf.  
Look out your window fair and you'll see me squattin' there  
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself.  
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up,  
After all my liquor's been drunk,  
After my dreams are dreamed out,  
After all my thoughts have been thunk,  
Well, after I do some of these things,  
I'm gonna do what I have to do.  
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide

And nothin' I know can change me, no need to get bothered  
I do more livin' than it might seem  
Some dream, livin' like a pauper, bless my darlin' daughter  
I'd like to know what makes a man go, over land and sea  
I guess it must get kinda lonesome, that's the way I used to be  
Another lazy mornin', no need to get down on anyone  
Such fun, coffee's in the kitchen, woman on the run

Gonna have a party a week from Saturday night.  
  
Well, thought I'd call you early,  
I thought you'd like to know there's gonna be a party, and I'd love for you to
go.  
I just want to give you time to get your story right.  
There's gonna be a party, babe, and it might last all night.

Now we're gonna play some music, and we can sing along.  
And I'll bet before the night is through, we'll play your favorite song.  
And when they play the slow dance and I'm holding you so tight, that's when
the party's startin', babe, and it might last all night.

461,Gordon Lightfoot,That Same Old Obsession,/g/gordon+lightfoot/that+same+old+obsession_20061617.html,"I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Early each day upon rising  
I think of my lost love from over the sea  
And sometimes I've wondered, if she thinks of me  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  
There's peace in the garden, there's peace in the air  
Peace in the sound of the river  
There's peace in the meadow, the sun shines like gold  
And if she were with me there'd be peace in my soul  
I long to return to the place I remember  
The taste of her lips close to mine  
I could do much better if I could be strong  
Come into my garden but leave me alone  
I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Just as the night comes stealing  
Someone is weeping, I'm calling her name  
Deep in the garden, deep in my brain  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart

The far away places you go  
If it rains or it snows may  
You be safe and warm and never grow old  
And if you need someone who loves you, why  
You know I will always be there  
I'll do it although I'm not supposed to care  
  
I'll give you the keys to  
My flying machine if you'd like  
I will show you the light and when you call  
I'm gonna come to you  
And when you find someone who loves you,  
I'll know you would treat me the same  
Just lie there, you're not supposed to care  
  
I think you have somebody waiting  
Outside in the rain to take you away.  
That's some kind of a game  
Still I'm glad it came down  
To the final round

You know I will always be there

Was wanted and had a place to stay warm

To feed the hungry in our midst  
I saw the time  
  
When the poor could still have pride  
And hard work paid off in time  
I saw the time  
When the homeless had a home  
And the old could carry on  
I saw the time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
When special kids got a chance  
And handicapped could advance  
I saw the time  
When we walked the streets without risk  
And families still prayed and hugged and kissed  
  
I saw the time  
When nature was so clean  
We could eat from the field and streams  
I saw the time  
And when the bombs would not explode  
And all the people got to vote  
I saw the time, I saw that time  
  
Oh, I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, I saw the time  
  
I saw the time  
When we went to the moon  
And disaster struck too soon  
I saw that time  
When little Samantha Smith was so brave  
And made that grin and call  
  
And when the Bears' Vincent Woody  
Paced the sidelines and coached football  
When John, George and Martin walked around  
(I saw the time)  
When John, Paul, George and Ringo  
Brought the sound  
  
When everybody held hands  
And the children smiled, mama's and daddy?s smiled  
Grandma?s and Grandpa?s smiled, and God smiled  
  
I saw the time  
Dream after dream, scene after scene  
Time after time, whoa, I saw the time

Or much less than I should own

My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord  
Down in New Orleans.  
  
Now the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time he's satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk.  
  
He fills his glasses up to the brim  
And he'll pass the cards around  
And the only pleasure he gets out of life  
Is rambling from town to town.  
  
Oh tell my baby sister  
Not to do what I have done  
But shun that house in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun.  
  
Well it's one foot on the platform  
And the other foot on the train  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
To wear that ball and chain.

I'm going back to end my life  
Down in the rising sun.

I've learned about survival  
I've walked with fools and kings  
And I've even read the bible  
There I came upon some lines  
Givin' me direction  
Gather not your gold on earth  
Your kingdom is in heaven  
But I chose to live instead  
Inside the shell they gave me  
'til in spite of everything  
Good fortune came to find me  
I tried my best to run away  
But I could not avoid the feelin'  
Soon I was reelin' on my feet  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone and let myself surrender  
I didn't want to die at all  
I thought I'd live forever  
Then she gave me everything  
A king could never borrow  
But I twisted all her gifts  
Her wisdom was my sorrow  
So I left her cryin'  
And roamed across the river  
The angels offered me their hands  
But I could not forget her  
So I came to where she was  
By river, road and reason  
I slept beneath her window  
In the moonlight summer season  
But I could not go inside  
I heard the sound of laughter  
And the rustle of her hair upon his skin  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone to cry down my sorrow  
I didn't want to live no more  
Nor face the bright tomorrow  
Then I remembered everything  
I've learned about survival  
Havin' walked with fools and kings  
I've even read the bible  
I remember all those lines  
Givin' me direction  
Gather not your gold on earth  
It will not pass inspection  
And still I think when I'm alone  
Away from all night splendor  
If gold could buy one night with her  
I wish I had some to send her

Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall  
To brown and to yellow they fade  
And then they have to die  
Trapped within the circle time parade  
Of changes  
  
Moments of magic will glow in the night  
All fears of the forest are gone  
For when the morning breaks  
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn  
Of changes  
  
Passions will part to a warm melody  
As fires will sometimes turn cold  
Like petals in the wind  
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls  
Of changes  
  
Your tears will be trembling now we're somewhere else  
One last cup of wine we will pour  
I'll kiss you one more time  
And leave you on the rolling river shore

All the way from New Orleans  
To Jerusalem. ""  
I traveled through East Texas  
Where many martyrs fell  
And I know no one can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
Well, I heard the hoot owl singing  
As they were taking down the tents  
The stars above the barren trees  
Were his only audience  
Them charcoal gypsy maidens  
Can strut their feathers well  
But nobody can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
See them big plantations burning  
Hear the cracking of the whips  
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming  
(And) see the ghosts of slavery ships  
I can hear them tribes a-moaning  
(I can) hear the undertaker's bell  
(Yeah), nobody can sing the blues  
Like Blind Willie Mctell  
  
There's a woman by the river  
With some fine young handsome man  
He's dressed up like a squire  
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand  
There's a chain gang on the highway  
I can hear them rebels yell  
And I know no one can sing the blues

And we all want what's his

I will not stand corrected, I have not harmed anyone  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride

Just let it ride  
Better I listen to my heart, I sometimes fail to find  
One sane and simple answer on the bright side of my mind  
Even when I'm sleeping, I can't seem to unwind  
I just let it ride  
I knew a man from Windsor who went to Detroit every night  
And stateside of the tunnel customs agents gave him flight  
He threw his stash in the river and his bedroll on the ground  
And when they finally got there, a sleeping man was all that they found  
He just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Hear the steeple bell ring out above my lobster pots  
I might be out here fishin' man but that ain't where it stops  
The mouths I feed are many and they all say thanks a lot  
They just let it ride  
One day when I'm old and gray an' consider what's gone by  
I always will be proud of every tear I've ever cried  
And all of the old jokes we told around the candle light  
To all those tender damsels who had helped us in the night  
They just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Here's to the girls from London and the ones from Montreal  
We never will forget them, we still fantasize them all  
I knew one in St. Louis on a Missouri afternoon  
I met one up in Shanghai and another in Rangoon  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
I'm gonna let it ride

There's something you must see.  
I want to be with you, gal,  
If you want to be with me.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm questionin' you.  
To take part in any quiz.  
It's just that I ain't got no watch  
An' you keep askin' me what time it is.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
I am just a poor boy, baby,  
Lookin' to connect.  
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'  
That I ain't got any respect.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
You know I'd have nightmares  
And a guilty conscience, too,  
If I kept you from anything  
That you really wanted to do.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.  
  
It ain't that I'm wantin'  
Anything you never gave before.  
It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,  
It'll be too dark for you to find the door.  
  
But if you got to go,  
It's all right.  
But if you got to go, go now,  
Or else you gotta stay all night.

Each and every rose bud you will find me gone  
So knock me down and pick me up  
And knock me down again  
Break my heart steal my gold  
And slander my good name  
Seven lonely hours on the morning train  
Takes me to a place where I won't come back again  
Seven lonely Pullmans speedin' down the line  
Takin' me away from an old love of mine  
  
Sixteen miles to seven lakes way up among the pines  
In some hidden valley where the twirlin' river twines  
Where the fish swim up and down  
And the sparklin' water falls  
Where the thunder rolls  
And the lonely puma calls  
  
Somewhere on the mountain I'll take another name  
Rid my mind of memories and start my life again  
Somewhere in the wilderness  
I'll build a cabin small  
Then forget so I  
Won't remember you at all

She comes to me in the dreams I've had  
In the morning light, in the dead of night

They meet me at a time when I'm calm and feeling fine  
But the captain of my soul is always on board  
He rocks me in his arms  
While I'm riding through the storm  
  
While riding through the storm  
Jesus hold me in his arms  
And I am not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains  
Although clouds become high  
Jesus holds me while I ride  
I find safety in the Master's arms  
While I'm riding through a storm  
  
I have no fear on the raging sea  
Knowing Jesus is there for me  
He can speak to the winds and the wave  
And make them behave  
All power's in his hand  
On sea or dry land  
I find safety in my Master's arms  
While I'm riding through a storm

As we followed in the dance

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet, green icing flowing down  
Someone left the cake out in the rain  
I don't think that I can take it  
'Cause it took so long to bake it  
And I'll never have that recipe again  
Oh, no!  
  
I recall the yellow cotton dress  
Foaming like a wave  
On the ground beneath your knees  
The birds, like tender babies in your hands  
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees  
  
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet, green icing flowing down  
Someone left the cake out in the rain  
I don't think that I can take it

In their sharkskin suits  
Bow ties and buttons  
High top boots  
Drivin' the spikes in  
Blazin' the rails  
Nailed in their coffins

Fly away, little bird  
Fly away, flap your wings  
Fly by night  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
All the early Roman kings  
In the early, early morn  
Coming down the mountain  
Distributing the corn  
Speeding through the forest  
Racing down the track

They drag you back  
  
Tomorrow is Friday  
We'll see what it brings  
Everybody's talking  
'Bout the early Roman kings

They destroyed your city  
They'll destroy you as well

Hell-bent for leather

Than all men put together

Wearing fancy gold rings

With a blood-clotted rag

To a bitch or a hag  
If you see me comin'  
And you're standing there  
Wave your handkerchief  
In the air  
  
I ain't dead yet  
My bell still rings  
I keep my fingers crossed  
Like them early Roman kings  
  
I can strip you of life  
Strip you of breath  
Ship you down  
To the house of death  
One day  
You will ask for me  
There'll be no one else  
That you'll wanna see  
  
Bring down my fiddle  
Tune up my strings  
I'm gonna break it wide open  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
I was up on black mountain  
The day Detroit fell  
They killed 'em all off  
And they sent 'em to hell  
Ding dong daddy  
You're coming up short  
Gonna put you on trial  
In a Sicilian court  
  
I've had my fun  
I've had my flings  
Gonna shake 'em all down

I was sittin' on a stump  
Down in New Orleans,  
I was feelin' kinda low down,  
Dirty and mean.  
Along came a fella  
And he didn't even ask.  
He says, ""I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast. ""  
I didn't think twice,  
I said like I should,  
""Let's go find this lady  
That can do me some good. ""  
We walked across the river  
On a sailin' spree  
And we came to a door  
Called one-oh-three.  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldn't even walk.  
He's linkin' and a-slinkin',  
Couldn't stand on his feet,  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street.  
Well, out of the door  
There comes another man.  
He wiggled and he wobbled,  
He couldn't hardly stand.  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes,  
Like he just fought a bear,  
He was ready to die.  
  
Well, I peeked through the key crack,  
Comin' down the hall  
Was a long-legged man  
Who couldn't hardly crawl.  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French,  
And he looked like he'd been through  
A monkey wrench.  
  
Well, by this time  
I was a-scared to knock,  
I was a-scared to move,  
I's in a state of shock.  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin' backwards  
Down that broad street.  
Well, I got to the corner,  
I tried my best to smile.  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile.  
Man, I wasn't runnin'  
'Cause I was sick,  
I was just a-runnin'  
To get out of there quick.  
  
Well, I tripped right along  
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.  
I musta run a mile  
In a minute or less.  
I walked on a log  
And I tripped on a stump,  
I caught a fast freight  
With a one-arm jump.  
So, if you're travelin' down  
Louisiana way,  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay,  
Man, you're better off

Now I know how it feels to lose  
This is lonely  
It's nothing anyone on earth can do  
Only time can heal  
This hurt I feel  
Cause he ain't coming back  
That's what he told me  
Now I'm lonely  
  
He did everything I wanted  
Still I took his love for granted too long, it seems  
There ain't nothing I can do to right this wrong  
And it's too late to turn back time  
And all my tears ain't gonna change his mind  
It's over, he said  
You don't love me anymore

When is the perfect time  
To spend the rest of your life

And sometimes it rains and snows  
And there will be highs and lows  
So only you will know  
  
You never know just where it will find you  
'Cause it can come on you so fast  
Seems like it takes forever  
When you want it so bad  
But don't ever take it for granted  
'Cause it's more than sowing some seeds  
It takes sun and water  
So give it what it needs  
  
And that's how you fall in love

I know what I want for Christmas this year  
I hope my note got to Santa on time  
I'm a little bit nervous  
It's kind of a big thing I'm asking for  
I don't know if I deserve it but boy if I get it  
I'll never ask for anything more  
It shines, it's new  
And it's the one wish that I wish would come true  
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you  
  
We can build a little fire  
We can sit and talk for hours  
We'll just have fun  
You can tell me what you did  
Christmas morning as a kid  
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come  
  
And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway  
I'm sure to get a kiss  
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow  
To complete this singular wish  
It shines, it's new  
I know what I want and nothin' else will do  
This year for Christmas, I just want to be with you

At the end of the rainbow life has only begun  
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above  
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love  
  
My wretched heart's pounding  
I felt an angel's kiss  
My memories are drowning  
In mortal bliss  
  
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall  
Love waits forever for one and for all  
  
Beyond the horizon across the divide  
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side  
Down in the valley the water runs cold  
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul  
  
I'm touched with desire  
What don't I do?  
I'll throw the logs on the fire  
I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared  
  
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue  
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

You make the best of each new day  
You try not to be sad  
Even though the sky falls down upon you  
Call it midnight, feelin' bad  
  
[Chorus: ]  
When you wake up to the promise  
Of your dream world comin' true  
With one less friend to call on  
Was it someone that I knew  
Away you will go sailin'  
In a race among the ruins  
If you plan to face tomorrow  
Do it soon  
  
The road to love is littered  
By the bones of other ones  
Who by the magic of the moment  
Were mysteriously undone  
You try to understand it  
But you never seem to find  
Any kind of freedom comin' clean  
Is just another state of mind  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
So take the best of all that's left  
You know this cannot last  
Even though your mother was you maker  
From her apron strings you pass  
Just think about the fool  
Who by his virtue can be found  
In a most unusual situation  
Playin' jester to the clown

Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis  
Of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails  
  
All the men I knew had sad and  
Sullen gray faces  
With distingue traces  
That used to be there  
You could see where  
They'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales  
  
Then you came along with your  
Siren song  
To tempt me to madness  
I knew all the while  
That your poignant smile  
Was tinged with the sadness of a  
Great love for me  
Oh, yes I was wrong  
Again I was wrong  
  
Now life is lonely again  
And only last year everything  
Seemed so sure  
Now life is awful again  
A troughful of hearts would only  
Be a bore  
A week in Paris will ease the bite  
Of it  
But all I really care  
Is to smile in spite of it  
I'll forget you  
I will and yet you are still  
Burning inside my brain  
  
Romance is mush, stifling those  
Who strive  
I'll live a lush life in some  
Small dive  
And there I'll be  
While I rot with the rest  
Of those whose lives are  
Lonely too

To each his own, it's all unknown,

They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,  
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.  
I can't help it if I'm lucky.  
  
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act  
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.  
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,  
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that

Blowing down the back roads headin' south.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike  
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.  
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,  
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won
the wars  
After losin' every battle.  
  
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are  
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
stars.  
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.  
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,  
Blood on your saddle.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,  
Blowing through the curtains in your room.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart  
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.  
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have
stopped,  
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top  
You're on the bottom.  
  
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes  
Don't look into mine.  
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
building  
Burned.  
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
springtime  
Turned Slowly into autumn.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,  
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read  
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.  
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,  
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory  
And all your ragin' glory.  
  
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,  
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from
me.  
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,  
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,  
And it makes me feel so sorry.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,  
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.  
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,  
We're idiots, babe.  
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.

Just a minute before you touch the door  
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?  
Do you think we can talk about it some more?  
You know the streets are filled with vipers  
Who've lost all ray of hope  
You know, it ain't even safe no more  
In the palace of the Pope.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Come over here from over there, girl  
Sit down here, you can have my chair  
I can't see us going anywhere, girl  
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there  
I wish I'd have been a doctor  
Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost  
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world  
'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
I ain't too good at conversation, girl  
So you might not know exactly how I feel  
But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountaintop, girl  
And build you a house made out of stainless steel  
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting  
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches  
But I know that I can't move.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on  
Tomorrow's just one step beyond  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Who are these people who are walking towards you  
Do you know them or will there be a fight?  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you what's wrong from right?  
  
Do you remember St. James Street  
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?  
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line.  
  
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection that's been misplaced, girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didn't dance.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.

They had to catch the outlaws before they crossed the borderline.  
  
Well, the lawman wanted justice the cowboy revenge  
They tracked the Outlaws' horses up to the river's edge  
And there across the Rio a badge ain't worth a dime  
The law was in their own hands once they crossed the borderline.  
  
So they ride to the desert wind down a dusty trail, destiny begins  
Heroes never turn or look back  
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline  
  
In the safety of the badlands the outlaws stopped their run  
The campfire rings with laughter of evil things they've done  
How they'd taken all they wanted and killed the cowboy's wife  
And knew no one would follow them, cross the borderline.  
  
The lawman and the cowboys stepped out of the dark  
And it was two against the twenty and every bullet found its mark  
And so goes the legend that out there in the night  
The two still ride together somewhere beyond the borderline.  
  
So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins

He is wild but he is mellow  
He is strong but he is weak  
He is cruel but he is gentle  
He is wise but he is meek  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a battered book into his hand  
Standing like a prophet bold  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
I have come o'er moor and mountain  
Like the hawk upon the wing  
I was once a shining knight  
Who was the guardian of a king  
I have searched the whole world over  
Looking for a place to sleep  
I have seen the strong survive  
And I have seen the lean grown weak  
  
See the children of the earth  
Who wake to find the table bare  
See the gentry in the country  
Riding off to take the air  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a rusty sword into his hand  
Then striking up a knightly pose  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
See the jailor with his key  
Who locks away all trace of sin  
See the judge upon the bench  
Who tries the case as best he can  
See the wise and wicked ones  
Who feed upon life's sacred fire  
See the soldier with his gun  
Who must be dead to be admired  
  
See the man who tips the needle  
See the man who buys and sells  
See the man who puts the collar  
On the ones who dare not tell  
See the drunkard in the tavern  
Stemming gold to make ends meet  
See the youth in ghetto black  
Condemned to life upon the street  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a tarnished cross into his hand  
Then standing like a preacher now  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Then in a blaze of tangled hooves  
He gallops off across the dusty plain  
In vain to search again  
Where no one will hear  
  
Through the woodland, through the valley  
Comes a horseman wild and free  
Tilting at the windmills passing  
Who can the brave young horseman be

Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?  
I've been burned before and I know the score  
So you won't hear me complain.  
Will I be able to count on you  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?  
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?  
Do you know my world, do you know my kind  
Or must I explain?  
Will you let me be myself  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,  
I've been in and out of happiness.  
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings  
And I've never been too impressed.  
  
All right, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you  
If I'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too.  
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow,  
Do you understand my pain?  
Are you willing to risk it all  
Or is your love in vain?

I've got some good news.  
  
I got some bad news, I don't know how to break to you.  
I found someone new since we been apart.  
I had too much time,  
An' he took you off my mind,  
An' I'm in love with him with all of my heart.  
I got some bad news.  
  
An' I guess all is fair in love an' war:  
Someone wins,  
But someone wins more.  
You never know what time will do.  
All I know is I've got some good news.  
I've got some bad news.

I want to be in the warm heart of your loving mind.  
To feel you all around me,  
And to take your hand along the sand,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When sundown pales the sky,  
I want to hide a while behind your smile,  
And everywhere I look your eyes I find.  
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing,  
T'would make me sing,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears,  
I want you near, to kill my fears,  
To help me to leave all my blues behind.  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be  
And long to be,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Every little detail  
You don't remember at all  
The times we knew  
Who would remember better than you?  
  
Forgetful heart  
We laughed and had a good time, you and I  
It's been so long  
Now you're content to let the days go by  
When you were there  
You were the answer to my prayer  
  
Forgetful heart  
We loved with all the love that life can give  
What can I say?  
Without you it's so hard to live  
Can't take much more  
Why can't we love like we did before?  
  
Forgetful heart  
Like a walking shadow in my brain  
All night long  
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain  
The door has closed forevermore  
If indeed there ever was a door

waiting to receive whatever will be  
the world the eyes survey is not the only world  
for deep within the soul can be found all things  
  
Like the shape of sound, the shape of wind  
like the shape of things when they first begin  
how could I stop what I had to start  
the cry of a waking heart  
  
(Chorus):  
All I want is to love you  
all I need is to get through  
what I believe is a light in the dark  
the crying of a waking heart  
  
You shine inside me like the moon in the stream  
and the waters flow around me  
  
Like the colour of sun I cannot explain  
behind the familiar the view is strange  
maybe to love is to fly apart  
and this emotion the cry of a waking heart  
  
(Chorus):  
(Bridge):  
Golden slumber  
now and forever  
truly rising  
imagine heaven  
one vibration  
this eternal thing

I'll take you off sailing from midnight till noon  
I'll show the Sea of Tranquility  
You can have any flavor you happen see  
  
I live in the shade of a forest of green  
In the wildest of woodlands that you've ever seen  
There's rabbits and quail and tender young snails  
As brown as the seaweed on old rusty nails  
  
There's fireflies dancing in the cool evening breeze  
There's love and romancin' as nice as you please  
There's otters and frogs and spotted ground hogs  
And wiley old weasels in rotted out logs  
  
There's rivers of rainbow and grey mountain trout  
And little dark holes where the varmints hang out  
There's foxes and hares in traps and in snares  
And lots of bald eagles so you'd better take care  
  
So if you've got the time and you'd like to pass by  
Come down around midnight and give us a try  
We'll show you the Sea of Tranquility  
You can have any flavor you happen to see

556,Gordon Lightfoot,Love And Maple Syrup,/g/gordon+lightfoot/love+maple+syrup_20061644.html,"Love and maple syrup goes together  
Like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  
When lonely lovers come to rest  
Beneath the trees they do their best  
But still they can't be free  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
If you go into the forest, gaze up through the leaves  
And see the sky that's almost wild  
You must learn to understand  
What makes the forest greet the man  
Like a mother's only child  
  
In the north when when winter's claw  
Relaxes now to keep the laws of nature in control  
People come and stand in line  
To rob the forest of her wine  
But they don't feel the cold  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
Love and maple syrup goes together  
Like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  
When lonely lovers come to rest  
Beneath the trees they do their best  
But still they can't be free  
  
Love and maple syrup shine like  
Embers warm, like thoughts divine  
They tell us it is spring  
Love and maple syrup stir  
The thoughts of people into words  
Of songs that they can sing  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood

Been all over the country,  
Started my share of new flames  
But after all is said and done,  
there's only one that remains  
  
[Chorus]  
Dixie fire burning down in my soul  
Dixie fire it never leaves me whole  
It took a hometown girl to show me  
How cruel these hot summer nights can be  
Now there's a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me  
Burning in the heart of me  
  
Searching for some kind of direction,  
Looking for a guiding light  
Needed to see a lighthouse,  
Like a ship on a stormy night  
Somehow you heard my music,  
You felt the sadness in me  
You took the words that were so cold,  
And added a warm melody  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Burn, burn, burning  
Burn, burn, burning (Cant you see that Im)  
Burn, burn, burning (There's a Dixie fire)

Down boulevards of broken cars  
Don't know what I do without it  
Without this love that we call ours

Nothing but the moon and stars  
  
Down every street there's a window  
And every window made of glass  
We'll keep on loving pretty baby  
For as long as love will last  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
But the mountains of the past  
  
Well my ship is in the harbor  
And the sails are spread  
Listen to me, pretty baby  
Lay your hand upon my head  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing done and nothing said

570,Gordon Lightfoot,Canadian Railroad Trilogy,/g/gordon+lightfoot/canadian+railroad+trilogy_20061665.html,"There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run  
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun  
Long before the white man and long before the wheel  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
  
But time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds  
As to this verdant country they came from all around  
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall  
And they built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us  
All  
  
And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring  
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring  
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day  
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay  
  
For they looked in the future and what did they see  
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea  
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land  
All up through the seaports and into their hands  
  
Look away said they across this mighty land  
From the eastern shore to the western strand  
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails  
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails  
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow  
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow  
  
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails

Behind the blue Rockies the sun is declinin'  
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day  
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping  
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away  
  
We are the navvies who work upon the railway  
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun  
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey  
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done  
  
We are the navvies who work upon the railway  
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun  
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges  
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done  
  
So over the mountains and over the plains  
Into the muskeg and into the rain  
Up the St. Lawrence all the way to Gaspe  
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay  
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down  
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town  
A dollar a day and a place for my head  
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead  
  
Oh the song of the future has been sung  
All the battles have been won  
O'er the mountain tops we stand  
All the world at our command  
We have opened up the soil  
With our teardrops and our toil  
  
For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run  
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun  
Long before the white man and long before the wheel  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
And many are the dead men too silent to be real.

Roll on highway, roll on along  
Roll on daddy 'till you get back home  
Roll on family, roll on crew  
Roll on momma like I asked you to do  
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on (roll on)  
  
It's Monday morning, he's kissin' momma goodbye  
He's up and gone with the sun  
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler  
And he's off on a midwest run  
As three sad faces gather round momma  
They ask her when daddy's comin' home  
Daddy drives an eighteen-wheeler  
And they sure miss him when he's gone (yeah they do)  
Ah, but he calls them everynight and he tells them that he lovesthem  
And he taught them this song to sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's Wednesday evening, momma's waitin by the phone  
It rings but it's not his voice  
Seems the highway patrol has found a jacknifed rig  
In a snow bank in Illinois  
But the driver was missin' and the search had been abandoned  
  
For the weather had everything strong  
And they had checked all the houses and local motels  
When they had somemore news they'd call  
And she told them when they found him to tell him that she loved him  
And she hung up the phone singin'  
  
Roll on highway, roll on along  
Roll on daddy 'till ya get back home  
Roll on family, roll on crew  
Roll on momma like I asked you to do  
And roll on eighteen-wheeler roll on  
  
Momma and the children will be waiting up all night long  
Thinkin' nothing but the words just comin'  
With the ringin' of the telephone  
Oh, but the man upstairs was listening  
When momma asked him to bring daddy home  
And when the call came in it was daddy on the other end  
Askin' her if she had been singin' the song, singin'  
  
Roll on highway, roll on along  
Roll on daddy 'till ya get back home  
Roll on family, roll on crew  
Roll on momma like I asked you to do  
And roll on eighteen-wheeler

I cried she was deaf.  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,  
Then said, ""What else you got left?""  
It was then that I got up to leave  
But she said, ""Don't forget,  
Everybody must give something back  
For something they get.""  
  
I stood there and hummed,  
I tapped on her drum  
And asked her how come.  
And she buttoned her boot,  
And straightened her suit,  
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""  
So I forced my hands in my pockets  
And felt with my thumbs,  
And gallantly handed her  
My very last piece of gum.  
  
She threw me outside,  
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.  
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,  
I went back and knocked.  
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,  
And I tried to make sense  
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  
That leaned up against--  
  
Her Jamaican rum  
And when she did come, I asked her for some.  
She said, ""No, dear.""  
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,  
You'd better spit out your gum.""  
She screamed till her face got so red,  
Then she fell on the floor,  
And I covered her up and then  
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.  
  
And when I was through  
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.  
And you, you took me in,  
You loved me then, you never wasted time.  
And I, I never took much,  
I never asked for your crutch  
And I don't ask for mine.

And gray in your hair  
And it only takes a touch  
To recall the love we've shared

You'll know my love is true

I'll whisper to you

Without the pies and casseroles

Goodbye fancy living room  
Well no one sleeps in Cash's bed  
Except the man in black and the woman he wed

To the anchor man out on the walk

Took off my work clothes and left them right there on the floor

You know tonight is a very important night  
For me for a number of reasons  
My little girl is here tonight  
And I don't think you understand  
What it's like being the daughter of  
Someone who's always gone  
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely  
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes  
""Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?""  
And so my daughter looked up at me  
Last week and she said ""mummy  
When are you just gonna stay home  
One day and be with me""?  
And so it kinda struck me funny  
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent  
Anytime with her for a long time  
So I sat down and wrote down this song  
After she went to bed  
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime  
I would sing her son  
I bet you ask yourself  
Why I'm never there  
It's not because I like being away  
You see I've made a spectacle of myself  
And it seems that the whole world needs me  
I understand when you cry alone  
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes  
You see it's only because  
I'm out being someone to make you cry  
I got a little letter  
And I read it on the plane  
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain  
I wish that I could be there  
To touch your face again  
Mimi you're beautiful  
Mimi you're mine  
And other things that I do in my life  
Seem to take up all your precious time  
There's so much I long to say  
So much more I long to do  
But I guess it's all just have to wait  
Till I can get to see you  
Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you fill my life  
You fill my life with so much love  
Cause you're beautiful  
And you love me  
And you'll understand

You'll say, ""What are you afraid of?""

He's got that soft silky skin  
He's got that fortress on the mountain  
With no doors, no windows, no thieves can break in

He says, ""Ya want a gun? I'll give you one."" She says, ""Boy, you talking
crazy""  
Handy dandy, just like sugar and candy  
Handy dandy, pour him another brandy  
  
Handy dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full or sorrow  
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table he says,  
""Okay, boys, I'll see you tomorrow""

Rainbows in the woodland, water to my knees  
Shivering, quivering, the warm breath of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Catbirds and cornfields, daydreams together  
Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes  
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons  
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons  
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Harsh nights and candlelights, woodfires a-blazin'  
Soft lips and fingertips resting in my soul  
Treasuring, remembering, the promise of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses

The kind of girl you'd like to see  
In a movie or a rosary  
  
She could be straight-laced or homespun  
Or free and easy on the run  
She could be meek and mild or full of fun  
  
She liked country lanes and aeroplanes  
And cigarettes would make her strange  
And when she wanted you she made it plain  
  
She would never say where she came from  
It didn't seem that she had anyone  
To answer to or dwell upon  
  
She liked candlelight and good wine  
And I would call her any time  
Of day or night she didn't mind  
  
The was nothing that I wouldn't do  
To prove to her my love was true  
And she gave to me a dream or two  
  
There were times when she would never appear  
For days and then she'd disappear  
But now the days have turned to years  
  
I was something she could use  
Like a good friend or a pair of shoes  
Or any kind of good news  
  
Now the eastern sky is crimson and red  
As I lie here in my lonely bed  
And think about the things she said  
  
She said darling there will come a day  
When I must run far away  
I will go my love and you must stay  
  
She departed in the early spring  
She didn't leave me anything  
To follow or to find her

598,Bob Dylan,Isis,/b/bob+dylan/isis_20021333.html,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May  
But I could not hold on to her very long  
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away  
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.  
  
I came to a high place of darkness and light  
The dividing line ran through the center of town  
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right  
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.  
  
A man in the corner approached me for a match  
I knew right away he was not ordinary  
He said ""Are you looking for something easy to catch ?""  
I said ""I got no money"". He said ""That ain't necessary"".  
  
We set out that night for the cold in the North  
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word  
I said ""Where are we going ?"" He said ""We'd be back by the fourth""  
I said ""That's the best new that I've ever heard"".  
  
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold  
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace  
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.  
  
How she told me that one day we meet up again  
And things would be different the next time we wed  
If I only could hang on and just be her friend  
I still can't remember all the best things she said.  
  
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  
He said ""There's a body I'm trying to find  
If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize""  
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.  
  
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous  
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn  
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious  
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.  
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had  
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly  
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.  
  
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside  
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover  
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied  
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.  
  
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes  
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.  
  
She said ""Where ya been ?"" I said ""No place special ?""  
She said ""You look different"" I said ""Well I guess""  
She said ""You been gone"" I said ""That's only natural""  
She said ""You gonna stay ?"" I said ""If you want me to, Yeah "".  
  
Isis oh Isis you mystical child  
What drives me to you is what drives me insane  
I still can remember the way that you smiled  
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.

No prima donna ways

And times is tough these days  
Remember when Mr. Barnum  
Presented Jenny Lind  
They named a candy after her  
A circus after him  
End of my story  
The rest is history  
She in all of her glory  
He lived quietly  
He needed her, she needed him  
As sure as the skies above  
In a way it was for them  
A lesson in love, a lesson in love  
You look like the moon glow  
That follows me home  
Always makes me turn around  
Won't leave me alone  
First to come are the midgets  
A monkey and a kid  
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers  
The ego and the id  
Songs of the season  
Apples of the sun  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just a time for each and every one  
Hang on Mr. Barnum  
Hang on Jenny Lind  
We will meet you in streets of gold  
Where eternity begins  
We will let it all hangout  
Go hand in glove  
Life was meant to live and learn  
A lesson in love, a lesson in love

Well, I've had my eyes on you for a long, long time  
So, I'm asking Santa please, make that pretty girl mine  
  
Waited till I'm cold and blue just to get a kiss from you  
I'm hangin' 'round the mistletoe, waitin' for you dear

Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I have played on my guitar  
In coffeehouses, hall and bars  
Everyone that I call friend  
Knows they will not be forgot  
Trains and planes and rented cars  
Singers, saints and other starts  
I suspect them every one  
They'll never change, it's too much fun  
Just for now I'd like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
I'll say a prayer for the world out there  
When I stand on my own sod  
It feels so good to be home, by God  
The winter wind has turned my head  
But I always came up warm somehow  
Bottles, beads and cigarettes  
And lovers that I ain't found yet  
Pickin' with a friend till dawn  
And singing all of those hi'way songs  
Just for now I'd like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
I'll say a prayer for the world out there  
When I walk the hill so high  
Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I would travel all my life  
If loneliness was not the price  
While headin' north across that line's  
The only time I'm flyin'

Are being stolen by bandits  
I must follow the sound  
The triangle tingles  
And the trumpet play slow  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is on fire  
And I must go.  
  
There's no need for anger  
There's no need for blame  
There's nothing to prove  
Ev'rything's still the same  
Just a table standing empty  
By the edge of the sea  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is trembling  
And I must leave.  
  
The jacks and queens  
Have forsaked the courtyard  
Fifty-two gypsies  
Now file past the guards  
In the space where the deuce  
And the ace once ran wild  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is folding  
I'll see you in a while.  
  
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting  
Perched in the sun  
Shooting tin cans  
With a sawed-off shotgun  
And the neighbors they clap  
And they cheer with each blast  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky's changing color  
And I must leave fast.  
  
King Kong, little elves  
On the rooftoops they dance  
Valentino-type tangos  
While the make-up man's hands  
Shut the eyes of the dead  
Not to embarrass anyone  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is embarrassed  
And I must be gone.  
  
The machine guns are roaring  
The puppets heave rocks  
The fiends nail time bombs  
To the hands of the clocks  
Call me any name you like  
I will never deny it  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is erupting  
I must go where it's quiet.

And he'll be rich and strong  
The man I love  
And when he comes my way  
I'll do my best to make him stay  
  
He'll look at me and smile  
I'll understand  
And maybe for awhile  
He'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word  
  
[Spoken:]  
You know I'm the kind of lady  
That always seems to find the wrong man  
At the wrong place at the wrong time  
It's not that I go out looking for him  
But somehow he always seems to find me  
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin' ""come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine""  
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man  
That comes home fussing  
And fighting, breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all

At the cradle she bought  
For the little tot she held to her breast  
And the song that she sang was an anthem to love  
It was all that I heard  
Till the powers that be took a liking to me

In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
There's a little bitty hole in the ceiling above  
Sometimes the rain drips down on our temple of love  
We have to put a pot smack dab in the middle of the bed  
Somebody hit my car at the diner last night  
Had to drive it home with one taillight  
When I went out this morning, the engine was dead  
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
There's a little cafe' on the corner of town  
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down  
And she don't sweat the small stuff

628,Donna Summer,Starting Over Again,/d/donna+summer/starting+over+again_20553440.html,"Mama moved out  
Daddy sold the house  
They split up the money  
And went on their way  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Could never put mummy and daddy back together again  
Starting Over Again  
Where should they begin  
'Cause they've never been out on their own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And the whole world cries  
He got an apartment  
She moved in with her sisters  
And he's scheming big deals with one of his friends  
While she sits at home  
Sortin' out pieces  
Of left over memories from thirty odd years  
Starting Over again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting Over Again  
Never any end  
What will the neighbours say  
(Just) talkin' talk it's small town news  
What will all the neighbours hear  
They just know they disappeared  
(They're) facing fifty years old wrecking up a happy home  
And this far down the road  
You find yourself alone  
Two fools  
Starting Over Again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Could never put mummy and daddy back together  
Back together anymore.....

And one night coming down  
  
15 years of heaven  
For one short night of sin  
From blue skies forever  
To an end  
From out on a mountain  
To both knees on the ground

And one night coming down

Her faith in my is gone  
My tears tell her I'm sorry  
But they can't write my wrong  
One night wrote my story  
How a man can lose it all

Mark now what followed and what did betide,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,  
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp  
And a little wee drummer intending to camp,  
For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.  
  
""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried.  
""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply,  
Intending no harm but meant to pass by,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist,  
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist,  
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,  
And drink the king's health in the morning.  
  
""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,  
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,  
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,  
And he always lives pleasant and charmin',  
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,  
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.  
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,  
And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""  
  
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,  
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,  
But you dare not change them one night, for you know  
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,  
And although that we're single and free,  
We take great delight in our own company,  
We have no desire strange places to see,  
Although that your offers are charming.  
  
""And we have no desire to take your advance,  
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,  
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,  
Where we would get shot without warning,""  
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat,  
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,  
For if you insult me with one other word,  
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""  
  
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,  
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades  
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head  
And bid them take that as fair warning.  
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,  
We flung them as far as we could in the tide,  
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride,  
""And temper their edge in the mornin'!""  
  
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,  
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,  
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,  
And bade it a tedious returning,  
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.  
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,  
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,  
And left them for dead in the morning.  
  
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,  
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,  
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts  
And bid them look sharp in the mornin'.  
  
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,  
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,

Does your mother know  
That you would go so fast  
Anyway, that's all you think about  
You'd call her if you could  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her  
That you've got ten dollars  
And you'll be all right  
And when you get straight  
You're gonna come back east some day  
  
Does your mother know  
You have a man in the West  
Does your mother know  
You drove him from your door  
Anyway that's all you think about  
You'd call her if you could  
  
Does your mother know  
You walked all day in the rain  
Does your mother know  
How deep your love could be  
Anyway that's all you think about  
You'd call her if you could  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light  
Just tell her they tell her  
That you've got ten dollars  
And your rent costs eight  
And when you get straight  
You're gonna come back east some day  
  
But the letters that you write  
In the faded winter light

When he ordered up his third one he looked around  
Then he looked at me  
And said, ""I do believe  
I'll have one more.""  
He said, ""I hate this bar and I hate to drink,  
But on second thought, tonight I think, I hate everything.""  
  
Then he opened up his billfold and threw a twenty down,  
And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground.  
I picked it up,  
He said, ""thank you, bud.""  
I put it in his hand.  
He said, ""I probably oughta throw this one away  
'cause she's the reason I feel this way.  
I hate everything.""  
  
I hate my job  
And I hate my life  
And if it weren't for my two kids  
I'd hate my ex wife.  
I know I should move on and try to start again,  
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.  
Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, ""I hate everything.""  
  
Said, ""that one bedroom apartment where I get my mail,  
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail,  
With a swimming pool, and a parking lot view.  
Man, it's just great.  
I hate summer, winter, fall and spring.  
Red and yellow, purple, blue and green.  
I hate everything.""  
  
I hate my job  
And I hate my life  
And if it weren't for my two kids

So I pulled out my phone and I called my house.  
I said, ""Babe, I'm coming home, we're gonna work this out.""  
I payed for his drinks  
And I told him thanks  
Thanks for everything.

Every night down at [Incomprehensible] Cafe  
All alone she sips her pina colada  
Talkin' to herself, dreamin' time away

Stole her heart many years ago  
He promised her, he'd come back and take her  
Around the world, bring her hills of gold  
Down on Longboat Key

She runs to meet them down at the pier  
She sees the fishermen, the nets and the sunset  
But she don't see him, her eyes fill with tears  
She stands there lookin' at the crystal blue water  
And in the coral she imagines pearls  
She makes believe, he brought them all the way from China  
Then the water swirls, the blue-green water swirls

Oh, they just laugh when she mentions his name  
She just keeps on waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting

Think of all the changes we've been through  
The laughter an' the tears

Little did we both know  
When we fell we gave up all control  
Though times get hard  
We're strong enough to carry on  
'Cause love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home

Told myself that this time we were through  
That passion wasn't pain  
My heart had changed  
But then in the morning light  
The feeling cut me like a knife  
And then I knew  
I couldn't walk away from you 'cause  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam

It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home  
Oh, we can drive ourselves so far apart  
Till the world gets in between  
Before you know, the distance grows  
Till never we lose sight of the dream  
But the wonder of it all  
Is our love will survive  
It never fails to keep us going  
It never fails to keep us alive  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together

Never knowing never feeling anything  
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw  
I walked along the roadway to a fountain  
Where lovers come to meet  
A hobo walked up to me, I could tell  
He didn't have enough to eat  
He said, ""good sir you look so kind  
And though the years have stripped me to the bone  
It seems I am the better man  
For in this place I've never walked alone

Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw  
""where will you be, my friendly, when your  
Telephone ain't givin' out no calls  
And when the seasons come to haunt you  
Will you still find springtime in the fall  
And when you're on your island  
Will you wave at every ship that passes by  
And will you feed a hungry man  
I thank you, sir,  
Now I'll just say goodbye""

Water's gonna overflow,  
Swamp's gonna rise,  
No boat's gonna row.  
Now, you can train on down  
To Williams Point,  
You can bust your feet,  
You can rock this joint.  
But oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?  
You're gonna have to find yourself  
Another best friend, somehow.  
  
Now, don't you try an' move me,  
You're just gonna lose.  
There's a crash on the levee  
And, mama, you've been refused.  
Well, it's sugar for sugar  
And salt for salt,  
If you go down in the flood,  
It's gonna be your own fault.  
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?  
You're gonna have to find yourself  
Another best friend, somehow.  
  
Well, that high tide's risin',  
Mama, don't you let me down.  
Pack up your suitcase,  
Mama, don't you make a sound.  
Now, it's king for king,  
Queen for queen,  
It's gonna be the meanest flood  
That anybody's seen.  
Oh mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?  
Yes, you're gonna have to find yourself  
Another best friend, somehow.

Honest work out in the fields.  
Cornbread in my momma's kitchen.  
Daddy saying grace before the meal.  
Family ties run deep in this land.  
And I'm never very far from what I am.  
  
[Chorus]  
I was born country and that's what I'll always be.  
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free.  
I got a hundred years of down home running through my blood.  
I was born country and this country's what I love.  
  
Moonlight and you here beside me.  
Crickets serenadin' in the yard.  
What more could two people ask for.  
Laying here in love beneath the stars.  
Now this is where I want to raise my kids.  
Just the way my mom and daddy did.

Droppin' quarters in the slot

Terror is on everyside though the leaders are dismayed  
Those who put their faith in fire in fire their faith shall be repaid

Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Shout a warning to the nations that the sword of god is raised  
On Babylon that mighty city rich in treasure wide in fame  
It shall cause thy towers to fall and make it be a pyre of flame  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Thou that dwell on many water rich in treasure wide in fame

So we didn't last  
Hey, we're not the first  
  
But then again  
If we give it one more try  
We might find the feeling  
Never really died  
And there's still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
And find the love we had back then again  
  
Off to such a good start  
But somehow it seems  
We've let our hearts  
Fall apart at the dreams  
  
We could throw in the towel  
Walk away with our pride  
Say it just wasn't worth  
All the tears that we cried  
  
But then again  
If we give it one more try  
We might find the feeling  
Never really died  
And there's still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
Let's find the love we had back then again  
  
Baby, if we want it bad enough  
We can make it better than it ever was

I'm just like him, the same as you  
I'm everybody's brother and son  
I ain't different from anyone  
It ain't no use a-talking to me  
It's just the same as talking to you.  
  
I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day  
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay  
I said ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come  
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine  
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you'd better run  
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you  
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen.""  
  
Well, I don't know, but I've been told  
The streets in heaven are lined with gold  
I ask you how things could get much worse  
If the Russians happen to get up there first.  
Wowee! Pretty scary!  
  
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree  
I want ev'rybody to be free  
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater  
Move in next door and marry my daughter  
You must think I'm crazy!  
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.  
  
Well, I set my monkey on the log  
And ordered him to do the Dog  
He wagged his tail and shook his head  
And he went and did the Cat instead  
He's a weird monkey, very funky.  
  
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on  
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun  
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist  
And my wig-hat was falling in my face  
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.  
  
I gotta woman, she's so mean  
She sticks my boots in the washing machine  
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude  
Puts bubblegum in my food  
She's funny, wants my money, calls me ""honey.""  
  
Now I gotta friend who spends his life  
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife  
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf  
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.  
I've got a million friends!  
  
Now they asked me to read a poem  
At the sorority sister's home  
I got knocked down and my head was swimmin'  
I wound up with the Dean of Women  
Yippee! I'm a poet, and I know it.  
Hope I don't blow it.  
  
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange  
So I look like a walking mountain range  
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse  
Out to the country club and the golf course.  
Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.  
  
Now you're probably wondering by now  
Just what this song is all about  
What's probably got you baffled more  
Is what this thing here is for.  
It's nothing  
It's something I learned over in England.

Were losing faith and close to giving up

Laid in their arms a tiny gift of love

One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart

Prayed as they kept vigil day and night  
Saddened by the twelve who lives were taken  
But also thankful one made it out alive

One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark  
It only takes one life to make a miracle  
One honest prayer coming from the heart

For the Savior they were told would come  
Then on that winter night there in a manger  
God blessed the world with his one and only son

Just take everything down to Highway 61""  
  
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night  
Told the first father that things weren't right  
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""  
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""  
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done""  
But the second mother was with the seventh son  
And they were both out on Highway 61  
  
Now, the roving gambler he was very bored  
Trying to create a next world war  
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor  
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before  
But yes, I think it can be very easily done  
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun  
And have it on Highway 61""

Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed  
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine  
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed  
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger  
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn  
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion  
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.

How to enter into the gates of paradise  
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours

A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks

They got some beautiful people out there, man  
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue  
They got mystery written all over their forehead  
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young  
They don't believe in mercy  
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see  
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route  
Turn you into anything that they want you to be  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Yes, I guess I loved him too  
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill  
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped  
Struck down by the strength of the will  
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this
whole town afraid  
From now on, this'll be where you're from

692,Bob Dylan,Black Diamond Bay,/b/bob+dylan/black+diamond+bay_20021331.html,"Up on the white veranda  
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.  
Her passport shows a face  
From another time and place  
She looks nothing like that.  
And all the remnants of her recent past  
Are scattered in the wild wind.  
She walks across the marble floor  
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.  
She smiles, walks the other way  
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down  
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.  
""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,  
Carefully removes his fez,  
""Am I hearing you right?""  
And as the yellow fog is lifting  
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor.  
She passes him on the spiral staircase  
Thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador,  
She starts to speak, but he walks away  
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
A soldier sits beneath the fan  
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.  
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.  
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,  
""Can you see anything?""  
Then the Greek appears on the second floor  
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,  
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,  
Says, ""Open up another deck.""  
But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,''  
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh  
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.  
He tried to grab the woman's hand,  
Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand.""  
She said, ""That ain't enough.""  
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags  
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.  
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,  
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""  
She knocked upon it anyway  
As the sun went down and the music did play  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
""I've got to talk to someone quick!""  
But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.  
He hung there from the chandelier.  
She cried, ""Help, there's danger near  
Please open up the door!""  
Then the volcano erupted  
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.  
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner  
Thinking of forbidden love.  
But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,""  
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the island slowly sank  
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.  
The dealer said, ""It's too late now.  
You can take your money, but I don't know how  
You'll spend it in the tomb.""  
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear  
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,  
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,  
""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""  
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray  
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A.,  
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.  
It seems there was an earthquake that  
Left nothing but a Panama hat  
And a pair of old Greek shoes.  
Didn't seem like much was happening,  
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.  
Seems like every time you turn around  
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
And I never did plan to go anyway  
To Black Diamond Bay.

Specially when it's calling out your name  
It's hard on the one who doesn't sacrifice  
The things the world has to offer nice  
Come inside, spend some time, stay alive  
It'll take your heart and it'll steal your mind  
  
Oh, they're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh, they're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You gotta go and buy it at the store

Look what's washing on the beach  
And Lord, I believe, from the heavens to the seas  
We're bringing Mother Nature to her knees

Let's leave some green on the ground  
It's only ours to borrow, let's save some for tomorrow  
Leave it and pass it on down  
  
Well there's a change taking place way on the mountains  
Acid rain is falling on the leaves  
And down in Brazil, the fires are burning still  
How we gonna breathe without them trees

Where Daddy taught me to swim  
And that water, it's so pure  
And I'm gonna make sure  
Daddy's grandkids can swim there like him  
  
Now we all oughta feel just a little bit guilty  
When we look into the eyes of our kids  
'Cause brothers it's a fact, if we take and don't put back  
They'll have to pay for all we did

I fell down like a house of cards  
When somebody pulled the queen.

'Cause you could spend your life  
Lookin' for your own reflection  
Time could blur the lines  
Between what's real and what's projected  
Had I known what I lost?  
What I gained, what it'd cost  
I'd still give what remains  
To be myself again.  
  
You must believe me when I say  
Don't live someone else's design  
Turn it around like a photograph  
The writings been there all the time.  
  
Now you can have all these hopes and dreams  
The ones I can't use anymore  
I don't know what it is you lost  
But I hope you got what you came for.

Sometimes I want to cry out loud  
I want to let it all hang out

Sometimes I want to just lay here  
Sometimes I want to disappear  
I want to show you all my fear  
But I don't want to let you down.

702,Bob Dylan,Dirge,/b/bob+dylan/dirge_20021491.html,"I hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed  
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.  
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,  
I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell.  
  
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed  
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?  
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,  
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.  
  
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,  
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.  
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,  
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.  
  
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,  
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.  
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,  
I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt.  
  
Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me  
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.  
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,  
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?  
  
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,  
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.  
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,  
I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that.

But my one wish on Christmas Eve is as plain as can be  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth  
See my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, ""Merry Christmas""  
It seems so long since I could say  
""Sister, Susie sitting on a thistle!""  
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be, if I could only whistle  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth  
See my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth

When you have found things were getting you down  
Don't try to run away  
Just wait for me  
And baby you'll see  
We'll make it through the day  
When you're walking alone  
Can't fight the heat  
And the people you meet aren't kind  
You just put your head out  
And take a step  
And there's no mountain we can't climb  
Oh when you have cried and the things on your mind  
Just seem to make you sad  
Forget everything  
Please come with me  
We'll laugh and we'll be glad

I still hear her advice  
She said don't ever bet against your feelings  
Always think twice  
Don't go and throw your love away  
To some man just for the night  
Promises, promises, don't waste your time  
If his intentions don't feel right  
Your reputation follows you wherever you go  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Don't need a bad reputation  
I'm so thankful momma I am waiting  
To find someone who  
Was looking in the same direction  
That you pointed to  
I'll never turn and walk away  
If my heart gives me the sign  
When the one, comes along  
He'll understand  
That the wait was worth the while  
Your reputation follows you wherever you go  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Your reputation can't be bought, it can't be sold  
Don't get a bad reputation  
Don't need a bad reputation

Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me  
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me

To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night  
She sent me a railroad ticket too  
To take me to her lovin' arms  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I bin out here many a long days  
I haven't found a place that I could call my own  
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on  
I bin stood up I bin shook down  
I bin dragged into the sand  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Well I bin up tight most every night  
Walkin' along the streets of this old town  
Not a friend to tell my troubles to  
My good old car she done broke down  
'Cause I drove it into the ground  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I look over yonder across the plain  
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground  
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound  
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal  
And Lord I need one now  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Now here I am with my head in the sand  
Standin' on the broad highway would you give a ride  
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night  
I went in town for one last round  
And I gambled my ticket away  
And the big steel rail  
Won't carry me home to the one I love

With a little help from the likes of me

We were all dressed up in still  
I don't recall the gist of it all  
But you drove the young men wild  
You could wrap me around your finger  
Till it caused my heart to break

And too much love to take

You can do it if you choose  
There was too much toil in dreamland  
And too much love to lose  
  
You make me do what you want me to do

You seem to be the wiser now  
Could it be you'be been deceived

I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.  
  
Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,  
Stretchin' out upon the grass.  
She gets all messed up and she faints  
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't.  
  
I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man.  
I want to be your lover, baby,  
I don't want to be hers, I want to be yours.

Tears I never had before  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Clouds a-atherin' o'er my head  
That kill the day and hide the sun  
That shroud the night when day is done  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Rain is falling on the meadow  
Where once my love and I did lie  
Now she is gone from the meadow  
My love goodbye  
  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
Where once the world was young as spring  
Where flowers did bloom and birds did sing  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Here in this cold room lyin'  
Don't want to see no one but you  
Lord I wish I could be dyin'  
To forget you  
  
Oh how I wish your heart could see  
How mine just aches and breaks all day  
Come on home and take away  
This ribbon of darkness over me

And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody

736,Gordon Lightfoot,Black Day In July,/g/gordon+lightfoot/black+day+in+july_20061532.html,"Black day in July  
Motor city madness has touched the countryside  
And through the smoke and cinders  
You can hear it far and wide  
The doors are quickly bolted  
And the children locked inside  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
And the soul of Motor City is bared across the land  
As the book of law and order is taken in the hands  
Of the sons of the fathers who were carried to this land  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
In the streets of Motor City is a deadly silent sound  
And the body of a dead youth lies stretched upon the ground  
Upon the filthy pavement  
No reason can be found  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
Motor City madness has touched the countryside  
And the people rise in anger  
And the streets begin to fill  
And there's gunfire from the rooftops  
And the blood begins to spill  
  
Black day in July  
  
In the mansion of the governor  
There's nothing that is known for sure  
The telephone is ringing  
And the pendulum is swinging  
And they wonder how it happened  
And they really know the reason  
And it wasn't just the temperature  
And it wasn't just the season  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
Motor City's burning and the flames are running wild  
They reflect upon the waters of the river and the lake  
And everyone is listening  
And everyone's awake  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
The printing press is turning  
And the news is quickly flashed  
And you read your morning paper  
And you sip your cup of tea  
And you wonder just in passing  
Is it him or is it me  
  
Black day in July  
  
In the office of the President  
The deed is done the troops are sent  
There's really not much choice you see  
It looks to us like anarchy  
And then the tanks go rolling in  
To patch things up as best they can  
There is no time to hesitate  
The speech is made the dues can wait  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene  
But the shapes of gutted buildings  
Strike terror to the heart  
And you say how did it happen  
And you say how did it start  
Why can't we all be brothers  
Why can't we live in peace  
But the hands of the have-nots  
Keep falling out of reach  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July  
Motor city madness has touched the countryside  
And through the smoke and cinders  
You can hear it far and wide  
The doors are quickly bolted

For a man like me

And the shadows lick the walls  
She knows when I'm asleep  
The dinner's served at eight o'clock on time  
And all is well by nine  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna

Rosanna moves across the floor  
Her perfume fills the air  
As she walks beside my easy chair  
I touch her hand once more  
And I may never sleep again  
I like the bag she put me in  
  
Rosanna knows the ways of a man  
But not the way I feel  
I don't really care what happens now  
It's catch me if you can  
For no matter what occasion should arise  
She likes to sympathize  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
Rules my heart

One Sunday morning, rain pouring down

Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are

In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
This rental car never went so far  
But with each passing mile on more dream has turned to clay  
Now that we've met and your eyes are all wet  
Let me fetch my guitar, there's a song I'd like to play  
I would gladly offer you my song  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
One never knows where the good times  
If you got some to spend,we'll do anything you say  
I'd never lie, well you know I've tried  
Though you think it's the drink that has made me behave this way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A

About this love that's so real  
Is it surprising  
I'm romanticizing  
About the way I feel

And why should the shadows come?

My constant friend is He

And I sing because I'm happy  
I sing because I am free

And I know He watches me  
  
Let not your heart be troubled  
His tender word I hear  
And resting on His goodness  
I lose my doubts and fears  
  
Though by the path He leads us  
But one step I may see  
His eye is on the sparrows  
And I know He watches me

And stay by my cradle till morning is ney.

755,Bob Dylan,I'm Not There,/b/bob+dylan/im+not+there_20828002.html,"She came all rightoned and she's all too tight in my neighborhood  
She cried both day and night  
I know it because it was there.  
It's a milestone, but she's down on her luck  
And she daily salooning, but to me too hot to book  
I would then.  
  
I believe where she'd stop in if she wants time to care  
I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care  
And I go by the Lord and where she's on my way, but I don't belong there.  
No I don't belong to her, I don't belong to every choir  
She's my prize forsaken angel, but she don't hear me cry  
She's a long hearted mystic and she can't carry on  
When I'm there she's alright, but when she's not when I'm gone.  
Heaven knows that the answers she's don't calling no one  
She's the way for sailing beautiful  
She's mine for the one  
And I lost her attention by tempation as it runs  
But she don't bother me  
But I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Now I've cried tonight like I cried the night before  
And I'm leased on the high some  
But I dream about the door  
It's so long she's forsaken by a fate with the tale  
It don't hang approximation  
She smiled Fare Thee Well.  
  
Now when I'll treat the way we all was born to love her  
But she knows that the kingdom weighs so high above her  
And I run but I wait  
And it's not too fast or slam  
But I'll not perceive her  
I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's all about division  
And I cry for a bail  
I don't need anybody now beside me to tell  
And it's all affirmation I received but it's not  
She's a long haunting beauty  
But she's gone like the spark  
And she's gone.  
  
Yes she's gone like the rainbow that shined in yesterday  
But now she's home beside me  
And I'd like to hear to stay  
She's a bone forsaking beauty and it don't trust anyone  
Now I wish I was beside her but I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's too hard to stake in  
And I don't far believe  
It's a bag full it's amusing  
That she's hard too hard to lead.  
It's a load, it's a crime  
The way she mauled me around  
Was she told for to hate me, but just don't forethink in clown.  
  
Yes I believe that it's rightful  
Oh I believe it in my mind  
I been told like I said one night before  
Carry on the grind.  
And this song gypsy told her like I said carry on  
I wish I was there to help her  
But I'm not there I'm gone.

She said she would always stay.  
But I was cruel,  
I treated her like a fool,  
I threw it all away.  
  
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,  
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.  
I must have been mad,  
I never knew what I had,  
Until I threw it all away.  
  
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,  
Love and only love, it can't be denied.  
No matter what you think about it  
You just won't be able to do without it.  
Take a tip from one who's tried.  
  
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,  
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,  
For one thing that's certain,  
You will surely be a-hurtin',  
If you throw it all away.

Once upon a time, there was a girl  
She lived in the land of never-never  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on, because she believed  
That once, once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'Cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time, in the land of never-never  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

Pay any dues at the expense of her pride  
Everywhere she goes, only love would know

Everything is trust, all the rest is dust  
Mother nature, mother dear, listen to us over here  
Are the sounds of laughter ringing true?  
Only love would know, only love would do

She says no, you say yes  
And that's how it should be I guess

May the light of love surround you tonight  
Everywhere you go, only love would know  
You think, you were wrong until  
You learned once and for all it's still  
One more lesson on the way

Not the kind you would try to walk around

Blood dryin' in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore  
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door  
But whatever it could be, makes you think you've seen me before

Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina  
  
His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud  
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd  
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed  
And the head of a hyena  
  
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?  
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?  
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek  
Angelina  
  
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina  
  
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode  
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed  
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road  
With your subpoena  
  
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?  
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game  
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same  
Angelina  
  
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina  
  
There's a black Mercedes rollin' through the combat zone  
Your servants are half dead

Come on down out of my sky  
I've been a long long time waiting  
Wonder why  
Some people say say  
They say that love comes only once  
Some people say say  
They say that love comes only once  
But oh, life is like a rolling stone  
God bless the child who's got his own yeah  
A million times in a million ways  
I'd give my life just hear  
To hear somebody say  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
And I really do  
  
Life can bring some tragedy sometimes  
So don't keep looking at the bad things  
Sometimes love can even blow your little mind  
Now I've seen it starting to happen  
You've gotta believe in the good things  
Believe in the good things  
You gotta believe that there's something that hold us in a sunny place  
You gotta believe that the sky won't fall  
Believe that's it's worth it all  
You gotta believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel  
And I know bad things sometimes happen for nothing  
But there's got to be reason we all found each other  
That we live and breathe and we need somebody else  
That's what I said  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
And I really do  
  
Like a river running wild  
Like a river running wild  
I wanna walk down a down a country mile, oh baby  
No no nobody loves me  
No no nobody loves you  
The way I do  
No one can love you the way I do  
Nobody no no nobody baby  
Can ever love you like I do  
And I really do  
Oh baby  
I really do  
Oh baby  
I really do  
I love you  
Baby I love you

770,Bob Dylan,Belle Isle,/b/bob+dylan/belle+isle_20021513.html,"One evening for pleasure I rambled to view  
The fair fields all alone  
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron  
Where beauty and pleasure were known.  
  
I spied a fair maid at her labour  
Which caused me to stay for a while  
And I thought of a goddess to beauty  
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.  
  
I humbled myself to her beauty  
""Fair maiden, where do you belong ?  
Are you from heaven descended  
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?"".  
  
""Young man, I will tell you a secret  
It's true I'm a maid that is poor  
And to part from my vows and my promise  
Is more than my heart can endure.  
  
Therefore I remain at my service  
And go through all my hardship and toil  
And wait for the lad that has left me  
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"".  
  
""Young maiden I wish not to banter  
It's true I come here in disguise  
I came here to fulfill our last promise  
And hope to give you a surprise.  
  
I've known you're a maid I love dearly  
And you've been in my heart all the while  
For me there is no other damsel  
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle"".

771,Bob Dylan,A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,/b/bob+dylan/a+hard+rains+a+gonna+fall_20021241.html,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?  
And where have you been my darling young one?  
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains  
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways  
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests  
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?  
And what did you see, my darling young one?  
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it  
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it  
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'  
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'  
I saw a white ladder all covered with water  
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken  
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you hear, my darling young one?  
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'  
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world  
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'  
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'  
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'  
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter  
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?  
Who did you meet, my darling young one?  
I met a young child beside a dead pony  
I met a white man who walked a black dog  
I met a young woman whose body was burning  
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow  
I met one man who was wounded in love  
I met another man who was wounded in hatred  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?  
And what'll you do now my darling young one?  
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'  
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest  
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten  
Where black is the color, where none is the number  
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it  
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it  
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'  
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

With those crazy friends of mine  
Head out on steel horses  
With wheels and we ride  
  
We burn up that road to old Mexico  
Blend in with the desert  
Just we amigos  
And we roll  
  
Cowboys like us sure do have fun  
Racin' the wind, chasin' the sun  
Take the long way around back to square one  
Today we're just outlaws out on the run  
There'll be no regrets, no worries and such  
For cowboys like us  
  
We talk about livin', babies, and women  
All that we've lost and all we've been givin'  
We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't done  
Drink one more cold one, come mornin' get up

For the mountains and Marian are calling me again  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will swallow up my tears  
All is well  
I left the cold midwestern towns behind  
There's a semi up the road ahead I'll take him in my time  
For the hot-blooded mountain love is calling me again  
And the vagabond within me cries  
The wind and rain might burn my eyes but I won't feel the pain  
For the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do  
  
All is well  
As I swing up to the border bent for hell  
And the service station man agreed I didn't look too well  
But the mountains and Marian are calling out to me  
And I got my bedroll on my back  
And everything that I could pack to see me on my way  
  
All is well  
I've made my peace and man, I'm feelin' fine  
And the losers that I left behind I'll think about some other time  
For the border men were all my friends they couldn't find a dime  
And the prairie towns go sailing by  
Saskatchewan there's mud in your eye I'm leavin' you behind  
There'll be hot-blooded mountain love to satisfy my soul  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along  
And the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do  
  
All is well  
The foothills are coming into sight  
Today is just a memory the future is tonight  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along  
And the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do

You to me were the best  
When there is no more  
You cut to the core  
Quicker than anyone I knew  
When I'm all alone  
In the great unknown  
I'll remember you.  
  
I'll remember you  
At the end of the trail  
I had so much left to do  
I had so little time to fail  
There's some people that  
You don't forget  
Even though you've only seen 'em  
One time or two  
When the roses fade  
And I'm in the shade  
I'll remember you.  
  
Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?  
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?  
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you  
With the rain blowing in your hair.  
  
I'll remember you  
When the wind blows through the piny wood  
It was you who came right through  
It was you who understood  
Though I'd never say  
That I done it the way  
That you'd have liked me to  
In the end  
My dear sweet friend  
I'll remember you.

Pack his raincoat show him out

Enough is enough

Enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now

But he turns out to be like every other man I loved  
Our love (I had no choice from the start)  
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)  
Our love (tearing us apart)

No more tears (no more tears)  
No more tears (no more tears)  
No more tears (no more tears)  
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had is  
  
I always dreamed I find the perfect lover,  
  
But he turned out to be like every other man I loved  
  
I had no choice from the start  
I've gotta listen to my heart  
Tearing us apart  
  
Enough is enough is enough

Enough is enough is enough

Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister  
Goodbye sugar  
  
It's raining, it's pouring  
There's nothing left for us here  
And we won't waste another tear  
  
No more tears  
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
Is enough!

And the hearts of youth are aflame,  
Everybody's movin', nothin' stays the same!  
Fields are turnin', the bridges are burnin',  
And the light turns night into day.  
It's the time to stake it or make it or break it,  
For the time flies quickly away.  
Oh, oh it's the time to start makin' your mark,  
And it's the time to get in the game!  
Everybody's movin', nothin' stays the same!  
  
Upwards, outwards, all around,  
They're reachin' for the sky.  
The ribbons of highway and roads of steel,  
It's a time to be alive!  
Oh, oh, ain't no ragin' river that we can't cross,  
Nor giant too tall to be slain,  
Everybody's movin', nothin' stays the same!

With a mid summer moon shining above

And I can picture the nights we shared alone

Tomorrow, I may be holding another girl

To say goodbye a little

My emotions interfere  
So I write it a little,  
And cry a little tear

Can't be with you  
I would kiss you oh so good

Sometimes two people just don't get along, it's time to hit the road.

Goodbye, farewell, so long, vaya con dios.  
Good luck, wish you well, take it slow.  
Easy come girl, easy go.  
  
We tried to work it out a hundred times, ninety- nine it didn't work.  
I think it's best we put it all behind before we wind up getting hurt.  
No hard feelings darling, no regrets,  
No tears and no broken hearts.  
Call it quits, calling off all bets, it just wasn't in the cards.

You see somebody naked and you say, ""Who is that man?""  
You try so hard but you don't understand  
Just what you will say when you get home  
Because something is happening here but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You raise up your head and you ask, ""Is this where it is?""  
And somebody points to you and says, ""It's his""  
And you say, ""What's mine?"" and somebody else says, ""Well, what is?""  
And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?""  
But something is happening and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek  
Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak  
And says, ""How does it feel to be such a freak?""  
And you say, ""Impossible!"" as he hands you a bone  
And something is happening here but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
You have many contacts among the lumberjacks  
To get you facts when someone attacks your imagination  
But nobody has any respect, anyway they already expect you to all give a check  
To tax-deductible charity organizations  
  
Ah, you've been with the professors and they've all liked your looks  
With great lawyers you have discussed lepers and crooks  
You've been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books  
You're very well-read, it's well-known  
But something is happening here and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you and then he kneels  
He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels  
And without further notice, he asks you how it feels  
And he says, ""Here is your throat back, thanks for the loan""  
And you know something is happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word ""Now""  
And you say, ""For what reason?"" and he says, ""How""  
And you say, ""What does this mean?"" and he screams back, ""You're a cow!  
Give me some milk or else go home""  
And you know something's happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, you walk into the room like a camel, and then you frown  
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground  
There ought to be a law against you comin' around  
You should be made to wear earphones  
'Cause something is happening and you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?

Forgetting your own name  
You won't need a reason just to be alone with Lavender  
For the light so warm and pure  
Will draw you like a flame  
The colors that surround you there will be the shade of Lavender  
Shadows dancing everywhere  
Like flowers in the rain  
You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to Lavender  
With words you never spoke before  
And will not speak again  
Oh sweet Lavender, I understand you perfectly  
There is no way that I can see  
You living by yourself  
Oh sweet Lavender, I must be with you constantly  
Your presence means so much to me  
Much more that life itself  
Oh sweet Lavender, as fragrant as the name you bear  
Please cast away the clothes you wear  
And give your love to me  
Oh sweet Lavender, your smile is like the golden sun  
I'd love to see you laugh and run  
As naked as the sea  
If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender  
Don't try and get the best of her  
She will not share the blame  
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender  
Then you must be very sure

There is no shame

Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer  
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere

Whom nature's beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes  
They tell me revenge is sweet, I'm sure it is  
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized  
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel  
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel  
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that

It's dance time in Texas and the music lifts you up  
It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
We'll go honky tonkin' honey take my hand  
  
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows  
We'll do that Texas two step and that old cotton eyed Joe  
Now it's time for a slow dance and we're waltzing oh so close  
It's dance time in Texas and your the one I love the most  
It's dance time in Texas and were striking up the band  
We'll go honky tonkin' honey take my hand  
It's dance time in Texas where the wine and music flows

Deeper in love with you  
I'm not the kind of guy  
Who gets swept away  
So here's what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna give you this heart of mine  
But that's where I draw the line  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm only gonna give you everything  
Take it a mile beyond the end of the road  
I'm gonna love you one day past forever  
But that's as far as it goes  
  
I know it may not sound like much  
But baby, make no mistake  
I'm gonna treat you with more tenderness  
Than any one woman can take  
I'm gonna make all your dreams come true  
But after that, baby, I'm through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You've got your limits, I've got mine  
I'm only gonna go the distance  
Time after time

Onetta there in the corner stands  
And she wonders where she is.  
And the rain still hurts,  
Some people seem to have everything.  
Nine a.m. on the hour hand

Twenty-eight years have come and gone.  
And she's seen a lot of tears  
Of the ones who come in.  
They really seem to need her there.  
It's a sacrifice working day to day.  
For little money just tips for pay.  
But it's worth it all just to hear them say that they care.  
  
She works hard for the money.  
So hard for it, honey.  
She works hard for the money.  
So you better treat her right.  
  
Already knows she's seen her bad times.  
Already knows these are the good times.  
She'll never sell out, she never will, not for a dollar bill.

802,Gordon Lightfoot,If Children Had Wings,/g/gordon+lightfoot/if+children+had+wings_20061579.html,"There's a love I hold dear  
And it shines through each year  
And it makes things seem different somehow  
It's for better or worse  
It's for people who thirst  
For a love that burns brighter right now  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
There were things that were said  
There were things that were done  
And a wife cannot stand too much pain  
And what I thought was best  
Couldn't please her much less  
But my love still goes on, that don't change  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my lips and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by

803,Gordon Lightfoot,Ballad Of Yarmouth Castle,/g/gordon+lightfoot/ballad+of+yarmouth+castle_20061662.html,"Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon  
And the anchors have been weighed  
From Miami to Nassau  
She's bound across the waves  
She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay  
Into the open sea  
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it  
Now the many years she's been to sea  
She's seen the better times  
She gives a groan of protest  
As they cast away her lines  
And the grumble of her engines  
And the rust along her spine  
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'  
But the sands run out within her heart  
A tiny spark glows red  
It smolders through the evening  
There's laughter overhead  
Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt  
And the drinks are passed around  
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'  
Now it's midnight on the open sea  
And the moon is shinin' bright  
Some people join the party  
And others say goodnight  
There's many who are sleepin' now  
It's been a busy day  
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'  
""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning  
Let someone understand""  
But her silent plea is wasted  
In the playin' of the band  
Everybody's dancin' on her deck  
And they're havin' such a time  
And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""  
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle  
The fire begins to glow  
It leaps into the hallways  
And climbs and twists and grows  
And the paint she wore to keep her young  
Oh Lord, how well it burns  
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'  
Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast  
The captain stands aloft  
He calls up to the boatswain, says  
""Boatswain, we are lost""  
For the ragged hoses in the racks  
No pressure do they hold  
And the people down below will soon be dyin'  
All amidships, oh she's blazin' now  
It's spreadin' fore and aft  
The people are a-scramblin'  
As the fire blocks their path  
The evil smoke surrounds them  
And they're fallin' in their tracks  
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'  
Oh then the ship, Bahama Star  
Comes steamin' through the night  
She sees the Castle blazin'  
And 'tis a terrible sight  
""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries  
""We'll save you if we can""  
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'  
""God help the ones who sleep below  
And cannot find the way  
Thank God for those we rescue  
Upon this awful day""  
Now the heroes, they are many  
But the times are growin' slim  
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'  
Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'  
She's cryin' like a child  
You can hear her if you listen  
Above the roar so wild  
Is she cryin' for the ones who lie  
Within her molten sides?  
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'  
But the livin' soon were rescued  
The ones who lived to tell  
From the Star they watched her  
As she died there in the swells  
Like a toy ship on a mill pond  
She burned all through the night  
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'

Take heed of the stormy weather.

Spanish boots of Spanish leather.

Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild?

Somebody made my heart sing  
And somebody touched my heart last night  
Somebody set me in flight

Getting under way we turned westward bound

To sea what ecstasy was worth

You got me believin' that I can't  
Live without ya  
Well if ya want it, well here is  
My confession  
Baby, I can't help it, you're my obsession  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
I wait at home by my telephone  
When I call your house, baby  
You're not home  
Knock on the door and rush  
Down the stairs  
When I open up, baby you're  
Not there  
When we're together and ya put  
Your arms around me  
Your love sweeps away all the  
Confusion that surrounds me  
You keep my mind  
Forever, ever in doubt  
You want me believin'  
That baby, I can't live without  
Protection that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
We stand alone, at my window  
And stare out, at the shadows  
Down below  
I feel your fingers on my face  
I want to stay, I want to run away  
Protection that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love

All you need is time, time,  
Time to make me bend  
Give it a try, don't be rude  
Put it to the test and  
I'll give it right back to you  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
Kick it around, take it to town  
Try to defy what you feel inside  
You better be strong  
Your love belongs to us  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
All I need is trust  
All I need is trust, trust,  
Trust to make it show  
I don't want to know everything you done  
If you get a tip then tell it to the eskimos  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
  
All we need is faith  
All we need is faith, faith,  
Faith to make it nice  
Kick it around, don't be rude  
If you're gonna make a mistake  
Don't you make it twice  
  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder  
And you know that we get  
A little older every day  
It's cold on the shoulder

818,Donna Summer,La Vie En Rose,/d/donna+summer/la+vie+en+rose_20249324.html,"I thought that love was just a word  
Sung about in songs I heard  
Kisses could reveal that I was wrong  
And love was real  
Hold me close and hold me fast  
The magic spell you cast  
This is la vie en rose  
When you kiss me heaven sighs  
And though I close my eyes  
I see la vie en rose  
When you press me to your heart  
I'm in a world apart  
A world where roses bloom  
And when you speak, angels sing from above  
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs  
Give your heart and soul to me  
And life will always be  
La vie en rose

Chorus:  
What makes us do the things we do heaven only knows.  
We think we've got a secret, but it always shows.  
I taught you how to cheat, you're doing fine.  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.  
  
But I still love you and so I pretend  
And hope I never see that look again.  
But if I do I know the fault is mine.  
I've seen that look on me a thousand times.

And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air

Said ""How ya doin, son?""  
I said ""Give me five dollars worth as fast as you can...  
'cause I'm really in a run.""  
He said ""What's your hurry on a day like this?  
If you move too fast, there's a lot you'll miss  
If you want to see what the good life is  
Just get out and visit awhile.""

Busy lines on telephones, sending a merry Christmas home  
  
Bells ringing everywhere, season spirit in the air  
Up and down the avenue, holiday dreams comin' true  
  
A choir singing songs of cheer, carols we all love to hear  
Rudolph with his glowin' nose, lovers under mistletoe  
  
Postman bringin' Christmas cards, reindeer out in the yard  
Frosty with his eyes of coal, present wrapped in pretty bows  
  
Sidewalks full of happy eyes, flakes fallin' from the sky  
Boys and girls at the big parade to see st. nick up on his sleigh

A devil when she held me close, an angel when she smiled.  
She always held it deep inside, but somehow I always knew  
She's go away when the grass turned green  
And the sky turned baby blue.  
  
And baby blue was the color of her eyes.  
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.  
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,  
And I still don't know why,  
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.  
  
She brought colors to my life that my eyes had never touched.  
And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much.  
I try not to think of her, but I fall asleep and do,  
And drift off where the grass is green and the sky is baby blue.  
  
And baby blue was the color of her eyes.

Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams  
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed  
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Think I'll go out and go for a walk  
Not much happening here, nothing ever does  
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want to talk  
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever it was.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man see my face and lives.  
  
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race  
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth  
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face  
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Outside of two men on a train platform there's nothing in sight  
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the trck  
The world could come to an end tonight, bt that's all right  
She could still be there sleeping when I get back.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart  
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.

Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway  
Many's the time I've wished that I were free  
But my love for you was too deep for my eyes to see  
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say  
Whenever the thought seems better off left alone  
I think of you then in a way that is ten times as strong  
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say  
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway  
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say  
Try to believe me, I'll do anything that you say  
Though it might grieve me, I'll do anything that you say  
Please understand me, I'll do anything that you say

837,Gordon Lightfoot,A Passing Ship,/g/gordon+lightfoot/a+passing+ship_20061566.html,"A passing ship  
I have found the open ocean  
Give me no lip  
The waves roll by as I pass on  
A sunlit sea  
On the first day of April  
How fresh the wind  
Will you miss me when I'm gone?  
How many words  
How many songs still unwritten?  
How many ships  
Of the line have come and gone?  
In the good old days  
May they never be forgotten  
They had heavy wind  
Or they had no wind at all  
A passing ship  
It is midnight on the ocean  
Had a real long trip  
I have been at sea all winter  
When my ship came in  
I was givin' up the ghost  
I think I should be  
Leavin' those passing ships alone  
When the sea runs high  
The sea runs wild and I'm unsteady  
And I think of you  
In the warmth of your home and family  
When love is true  
There is no truer occupation  
And may this gale  
Blow us to the ones we love  
Another day, another ocean  
Give me no lip  
But stand aside as I pass on  
A sunlit sea  
On the last day in October  
How fresh the wind  
Will you miss me from now on?  
I guess I should be  
Leavin' passing ships alone

838,Donna Summer,I Love You,/d/donna+summer/i+love+you_10087851.html,"From my once upon a time album  
A song about two people who fell in love  
Showing up one day face to face  
  
Well he searched and searched for nights and days  
Till he found the one he loved  
And he wrapped her in his arms again  
And then he thanked the stars above  
That he found what he'd been looking for  
And he stared her in the eyes  
  
He said ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
She stared him right back in the eyes  
With a look of disbelief  
Then she gazed off into somewhere else  
Was it real or just a dream?  
And she pulled him oh so close to her  
And she whispered in his ear  
  
She said ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
  
They said ""I love you""  
Yes, they really do  
They said ""I love you""  
Yes, they do  
  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
So if you find someone you love a lot  
You must never let them go  
You just hold them tight with all your might  
And you say three little words  
  
You say ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
You say ""I love you""  
Yes I do  
You say ""I love you""

Oh i'm running slower, slower and slower to somewhere

It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare  
No matter which way-mare  
  
Spoken:  
Seems that there must be some way to get out.  
But i just can't find it.  
  
People pushing, hustling, rushing on into the future  
Windows open, closing, in a way that they just never used to  
Oh there's violence lurking in the alleys  
Where no one should dare go  
So keep walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere  
  
I gotta get out, somebody...that guy came at me with a gun

And the icy wind did blow  
The water seeped into his shoes  
And the drizzle turned to snow  
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead  
And the wine was runnin' low  
And the old man came home  
From the forest  
  
His tears fell on the sidewalk  
As he stumbled in the street  
A dozen faces stopped to stare  
But no one stopped to speak  
For his castle was a hallway  
And the bottle was his friend  
And the old man stumbled in  
From the forest  
  
Up a dark and dingy staircase  
The old man made his way  
His ragged coat around him  
As upon his cot he lay  
And he wondered how it happened  
That he ended up this way  
Getting lost like a fool  
In the forest  
  
And as he lay there sleeping  
A vision did appear  
Upon his mantle shining  
A face of one so dear  
Who had loved him in the springtime  
Of a long-forgotten year  
When the wildflowers did bloom  
In the forest  
  
She touched his grizzled fingers  
And she called him by his name  
And then he heard the joyful sound  
Of children at their games  
In an old house on a hillside  
In some forgotten town  
Where the river runs down  
From the forest  
  
With a mighty roar the big jets soar  
Above the canyon streets  
And the con men con but life goes on  
For the city never sleeps  
And to an old forgotten soldier  
The dawn will come no more  
For the old man has come home  
From the forest

And I do hope you receive it well,

Please heed these words that I speak.  
I know you've suffered much,  
But in this you are not so unique.  
All of us, at times, we might work too hard  
To have it too fast and too much,  
And anyone can fill his life up  
With things he can see but he just cannot touch.  
  
Dear landlord,  
Please don't dismiss my case.  
I'm not about to argue,  
I'm not about to move to no other place.  
Now, each of us has his own special gift  
And you know this was meant to be true,  
And if you don't underestimate me,  
I won't underestimate you.

I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

855,Bob Dylan,House Carpenter,/b/bob+dylan/house+carpenter_20021273.html,"Well met, well met, my own true love  
Well met, well met, cried she  
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea  
And it's all for the love of thee  
  
I could have married a King's daughter there  
She would have married me  
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there  
It's all for the love of thee  
  
Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there  
I'm sure you're the one to blame  
For I am married to a house carpenter  
And I'm sure he's a fine young man  
  
Forsake, forsake your house carpenter  
And come away with me  
I'll take you where the green grass grows  
On the shores of sunny Italy  
  
So up she picked her babies three  
And gave them kisses, one, two, three  
Saying ""take good care of your daddy while I'm gone  
And keep him good company.""  
  
Well, they were sailin' about two weeks  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck  
Sayin' she wants company  
  
""Well, are you weepin' for your house and home?  
Or are you weepin' for your babies three?""  
""Well, I'm not weepin' for my house carpenter  
I'm weepin' for my babies three.""  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as white as snow  
Those are the hill of heaven, my love  
You and I'll never know  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as dark as night  
Those are the hills of hell-fire my love  
Where you and I will unite  
  
Oh twice around went the gallant ship  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak  
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea

There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
I'm happy standing in these shoes  
With you here in my life  
The world is looking bright  
On this side of the moon  
  
Sometimes on a clear night  
We pulled out a chair in the yard  
And I'm always amazed  
At the good lord can make so many stars  
  
But I know I'd feel out of place  
Longing through the milky ways  
All you expect a astronaut  
I'd think I'd rather stay

The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write  
But songs of love will never leave love's feelings undefiled  
The tide has turned, the waves roll in, the waters fill my eyes  
  
The price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand  
The tears I shed were not in shame, the world was in my hands  
If trust was just a simple thing then trusting I would be  
But deep within my soul I know it's better to be free  
  
The days fly by, the waves roll in, but freedom has not come  
I fear my faith will soon give out, my senses come undone  
My role is played, the demon dogs come stealin' o'er land  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand  
  
I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight  
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write  
But songs of love should not be sung where staying is not planned  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand

Waiting through the years

Bitter Green they called her walking in the sun  
Loving everyone that she met  
Bitter Green they called her waiting in the sun  
Waiting for someone to take her home  
  
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea  
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free  
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist  
Dreaming of a kiss

But now the Bitter Green is gone the hills have turned to rust  
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust  
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist  
Dreaming of a kiss

Please see she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howlin' winds  
Please see if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breast  
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long

See the silver wing on high

For above the clouds she flies  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall

Till his pappy found him behind the barn just working up an awful storm  
As he tried to imitate the auctioneer.  
And his pop said ""Son, we just can't stand to have a mediocre man  
Selling things at auction using our good name.

He come back home a full fledged auctioneer.  
And the people would come from miles around  
Just to hear him make that rhythmic sound  
That filled their hearts with such a happy cheer.  
And his fame spread out from shore to shore, he'd all that he could do and
more,  
He had to buy a plane to get around.

Sitting on the back porch glidin'  
Whetting my appetite  
  
Well, I'm a six-pack high  
And start missing the light of my baby's eyes  
Wasn't it beautiful, the kind of a soul they said would never die  
  
Well, it's muggy in the shack  
And the backwoods are black  
'Cause the clouds hid the moon away  
The light from my cigarette flickers in the dark  
The only way she knows I'm here  
Then suddenly the sounds of the fiddles and accordions  
Sweetly begin to play and I can almost hear her sweet voice say  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on Joe, just count to ten  
Pull yourself together again  
And come on Joe, you gotta get hold of this mood you're in  
Come on Joe, you gotta be strong  
You're still young and life goes on to carry on  
'Til we're together again  
  
Hey, I know she's right  
But it's hard to fight when you're hurtin' so  
I tried to walk out of that door before but I just can't go  
With the tears and the laughter in every rafter in every room  
Wasn't it beautiful  
Wasn't it the kind of happiness and glow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on Joe  
Hey, come on Joe  
To carry on 'til we're together again

873,George Strait,House Across The Bay,/g/george+strait/house+across+the+bay_20980771.html,"Walkin' down this lonely stretch of beach  
She and I, walked down a thousand times  
I just can't force myself to give her up  
Like all the things she left behind  
Gone are the days when I'd wake up  
With her warm body next to mine  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
Her laughter was contagious  
Her walk, her talk, her smile lit up every room.  
They say things happen for a reason,  
But I can't find one good reason  
Why she's gone so soon.  
Life just seems to hang  
On every thought and everything  
We used to be.  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
There was sunshine everyday  
And we'd love the night away  
In that house across the bay.

874,Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's Dream,/b/bob+dylan/bob+dylans+dream_20021589.html,"While riding on a train goin' west,  
I fell asleep for to take my rest.  
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,  
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.  
  
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,  
Where we together weathered many a storm,  
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,  
Our words were told, our songs were sung,  
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied  
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,  
We never thought we could ever get old.  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one.  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white,  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.  
  
How many a year has passed and gone,  
And many a gamble has been lost and won,  
And many a road taken by many a friend,  
And each one I've never seen again.  
  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
That we could sit simply in that room again.  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,  
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

In this place  
Is really bad  
Like being  
In the bottom  
Of a stream  
Any minute now  
I'm expecting  
To wake up  
From a dream  
Miss so much  
The softest touch  
Like the grave  
Of some child child  
Who neither wept  
Nor smiled  
I'm hiding my faith  
In the rain  
I've been  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Somewhere dawn  
Is breaking  
Light is streaking  
Across the floor  
Church bells  
Are ringing  
I wonder who  
They're ringing for  
Travel under any star  
You'll see me  
Wherever you are  
  
The shadowy past  
Is so vague and so vast  
I'm sleeping  
In the balance of pain  
I've been dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Maybe they'll get me  
Maybe they won't  
But whatever  
It won't be tonight  
I wish your hand  
Was in mine right now  
We could go  
Where the moon is wide  
  
For years  
They had me  
Locked in a cage  
Then they threw me  
Onto the stage  
Somethings  
Just last longer  
Then you  
Thought they would  
And they never  
Ever explain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Well  
I eat when I'm hungry  
Drink when I'm dry  
Live my life  
On the square  
Even if the flesh  
Falls off my face  
It won't matter as long  
As you're there  
  
Feel like  
A ghost in love  
Underneath  
The heavens above  
Feel further away  
Then I ever did before  
Feel further  
Than I can take  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Everything in the way  
Is so shy like the day  
In queer and unusual form  
Spirals of golden haze here  
In there in a blaze  
Like beams of light  
In a star  
  
Maybe you're here  
Or maybe you weren't  
Maybe you  
Touched somebody  
And got burned  
The silent sun  
Has got me on the run  
Burning a hole  
In my brain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane

890,George Strait,I Found Jesus On The Jailhouse Floor,/g/george+strait/i+found+jesus+on+the+jailhouse+floor_10130454.html,"There once was a time when I was dead inside  
I cussed the Lord for the day I was born  
And prayed to the Devil to die  
Just when I thought the Devil had won  
Someone opened up the door  
The King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor  
  
[Chorus]  
Now, he broke the chains that bound me, and now I'm free  
Today I'm right where Mama  
Prayed I'd be  
I'm down on my knees  
Now I believe  
What Mama knew for sure  
He's King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor  
  
Now, if you're in trouble friend, let me tell you what to do  
I'll tell you what he's done for me  
And I know what he'll do for you  
It makes no difference what you've done  
You've a friend in the One that I adore  
The King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor

He's King of kings

I wonder how the old folks are tonight  
Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face  
She left me not knowin' what to do  
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Turnin' back the pages to the times I love best  
I wonder if she'll ever do the same  
Now the thing that I call livin' is just bein' satisfied  
With knowin' I got no one left to blame  
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Searchin' through the fragments of my dream-shattered sleep  
I wonder if the years have closed her mind  
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin' to get free  
From the good old faithful feelin' we once knew  
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway, you seen better days  
The mornin' after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway, let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway, got ta see you my old flame

897,Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's 115Th Dream,/b/bob+dylan/bob+dylans+115th+dream_20021320.html,"I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land  
I yelled down to Captain Arab, I'll have ya understand,  
Who came running to the deck and said ""Boys! Forget the whale -  
We're goin' over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails.""  
""Haul on that bowline!"" we sang that melody,  
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.  
  
""I think I'll call it America."" I said as we hit land.  
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.  
Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds  
And said ""Let's build us a fort and start buying the place with beads.?  
Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon  
And throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons.  
  
Aw, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how,  
I went lookin' for some help, I walked past a Guernsey cow  
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums  
Where people carried signs around sayin' ""BAN THE BUMS!"".  
I jumped right in line, sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""  
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.  
  
I went into a restaurant lookin' for the cook -  
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.  
The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.  
I ordered up some Suzette, I said ""Could you please make that crepe?""  
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -  
Food was flyin' everywhere - I left without my hat.  
  
I didn't mean to be nosy so I went into a bank  
To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.  
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.  
They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from France  
Who invited me to her place. I went, but she had a friend  
Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again.  
  
I went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.  
I said ""Can you please help me out, I got some friends down the way.""  
The man said ""Get out of here or I'll tear you limb from limb.""  
I said ""You know, they refused Jesus, too."" He said ""You're not him.  
Get out of here before I break your bones. I'm not your pop.""  
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.  
  
I ran back outside and got into a cab  
I ran out the other door - this English man said ""Fab!""  
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood  
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.  
I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,  
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was  
I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.  
He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die.""  
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,  
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.  
A pay phone was ringin' - and it just about blew my mind -  
When I picked it up an' said ""hello"", this foot came through the line!  
  
Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab  
At gettin' any help for my friends and Captain Arab.  
I needed a coin to flip, like either heads or tails,  
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.  
So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip.  
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship.  
  
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.  
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.  
They asked me my name and I said ""Captain Kidd"".  
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did.  
I said ""For the Pope of Eyruke I was employed""  
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.  
  
Well the last I heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale  
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,  
But the funniest thing was - as I was leavin' the bay -  
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.  
So I asked the Captain what his name was an' how come he didn't drive a
truck??  
He said his name was Columbus an' I just said ""Good luck...""

898,George Strait,I Saw God Today,/g/george+strait/i+saw+god+today_20732125.html,"I just walked down the street to the coffee shop  
Had to take a break  
I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight  
I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk  
Pushing up through the concrete  
Like it was planted right there for me to see  
The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns  
All seemed to fade away  
In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08  
I saw God today  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been to church  
I've read the book  
I know He's here, but I don't look  
Near as often as I should  
Yeah, I know I should  
His fingerprints are everywhere  
I'd just slow down to stop and stare  
Opened my eyes and man I swear  
I saw God today  
  
I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands  
Man, she had that glow  
Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show  
It stood there for a minute takin' the sky  
Lost in that sunset  
A splash of amber melted in the shades of red  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass  
She's sleeping like a rock  
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks  
She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes  
My brand new baby girl  
She's a miracle  
I saw God today

With a dollar in my hand  
And an achin' in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
  
I'm a long way from home  
And I miss my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big 707 set to roll  
But I'm stuck here on the ground  
Where the pavement never grows  
  
The liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
Well there she goes, my friend  
She's movin' out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wings on high  
She's away and westward bound  
High above the clouds she'll fly  
  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines.  
She'll be flyin' o'er my home  
In about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down  
Ain't no earthly good to me  
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
  
You can't hop a jet plane  
The way you can a freight train  
So I'll just be on my way

Singing through the trestle we would climb  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time

We played for just a nickel every time we got to town  
And I bought you a dime diamond ring  
In the hayloft we would play, we were princesses and kings

Gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
Born in the country and I like that country way  
Of the uncles aunts and cousins, and the card games they would play  
While the young ones slept overhead  
Beneath the quilts that mother made, when all the prayers were said  
And I need to be there when the autumn wind  
Goes singing through the trestle we would climb

You opened up pandora's box

And end up being really worthless  
And oh when I opened up the door to you  
I opened up pandora's box  
  
Just one look and I knew you knew  
I was all hung up hung up on loving you  
I just put all my trust in love  
And I placed a big old bet on lady love  
I was sentenced to loving you  
And I'm serving time in solitude  
Yeah I gave ya everything that I got  
And you took it all and walked right off

But it's hard to see the stars with these tears in my eyes

There's twenty-six reasons why  
  
There's broken hearts that'll never be the same  
Shattered lives still reeling from the pain  
Of plans and dreams now gone  
Oh, how do you move on?  
  
But I believe  
There's someone who's looking after me  
Someone beside me night and day  
To light the way  
It's hard to conceive  
Something you can't see  
But I believe  
I believe  
  
There's twenty-six angels looking down from above  
Resting in his mercy, grace and love  
Time may never heel  
The sadness that we feel  
  
But I believe  
There's someone who's looking after me  
Someone beside me night and day  
To light the way

Turning the wheels of chance  
Searching to find romance

When a tall and mystic man took me by the hand

Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino  
  
I was feeling so dizzy and lame  
Was it champagne or really him to blame  
Though our faces were disguised  
Feelings couldn't hide  
That this wasn't just some kind of game

Domino I'd like to know  
Domino who's the real domino  
Though we're strangers still  
It's real love I feel domino  
  
Then at midnight the bells were all rung  
And he kisses me and held me in his arms  
Then a crowd would ride between us  
Trapped away my stranger  
And I never did find him again

Of love lost running though

Looking at the wind  
Watching it spin  
The leaves along the street  
You win  
  
Waiting for a line to fall  
Telling you it's all a big mistake  
  
Looking at a face  
So out of place  
Inside that picture frame  
Of lace  
Looking at the wall  
Wishing you'd call  
And tell me you're okay  
That's all  
  
Wishing this was all a dream  
And I'd find you sleeping when I wake  
  
Looking at the trees  
So ill at ease  
From sleep that will not come  
That's me  
Looking at the dawn  
Knowing it's wrong  
Still thinking of your love  
That's gone  
  
Wishing this was all a dream  
And I'd find you sleeping when I wake  
  
Looking at the rain

Of love lost running though

The strength you need will be yours in time

Through the love that's been lost through goodbye

Round our house the grass was green,  
It didn't seem like things were all that bad,  
  
I bet we walked a thousand miles,  
Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,  
And learnin' how to give it all we had.  
  
As Life went on and years went by,  
I saw the light in daddy's eye,  
And felt the love in mamma's hands,  
They kept us warm and kept us fed,  
Taught us how to look ahead,  
Now lookin' back I understand.

Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
When Sunday mornings rolled around,  
We dressed up hand-me-downs,  
Just in time to gather with the church,  
Some times I think how long It's been,  
And how it impressed me then,  
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.

Pacing round like little boys do

He was dirty from head to toe  
And when it came his time to pay  
I couldn't believe what I heard him say

Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size

And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful

And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here.  
He searched his pockets franticly

He said Mama made Christmas good at our house  
Most years she just did without  
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do  
Somehow I've gotta buy her these Christmas shoes  
  
So I laid the money down  
I just had to help him out  
And Ill never forget the look on his face  
When he said Mamas gonna look so great

I looked in someone's eyes  
And felt the fire burning in my heart  
For the very first time  
She was scared and young  
And had never tasted love  
So I took her by the hand  
And a boy became a man  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
And once upon a lifetime  
You hold the Queen of Hearts  
And if you gamble on a diamond win  
The dealin' starts  
  
You stand to lose it all  
As the cards begin to fall  
And the lesson learned is hard  
You're only dealt the Queen of Cards  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
  
Once upon a lifetime  
You know that you've been blessed  
When you hold your first born tenderly against your chest  
  
And through the innocence you see  
The value of a family  
And you feel a special bond  
That only comes along  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
And people only find love like yours and mine  
Once upon a lifetime

I found myself not feeling any pain  
I told a 'Frisco girl I'd come for freedom  
She said she'd only come to catch a train  
  
We struck up some idle conversation  
Traded all the troubles on our minds  
One thing led to another in the evening  
And I fell in love again for my last time  
  
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason  
Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason  
That I fell in love again for my last time  
  
Daylight dawned and found me in Del Rio  
In a rundown motel room as dark as hell  
I felt all the pains of a morning after  
And all alone as far as I could tell  
  
Why she left I have no way of knowing  
I guess she caught her train and that's a crime  
She took everything I ever wanted  
And I fell in love again for my last time  
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason  
Say too much guitar music, tequila, salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico, but she's the reason

My head bowed in my hands  
Not knowin' where to sit  
Not knowin' where I stand  
My father looms above me  
For him there is no rest  
My mothers arms enfold me  
And hold me to her breast  
They say you been out wanderin'  
They say you travelled far  
Sit down young stranger  
And tell us who you are  
The room has all gone misty  
My thoughts are all in spin  
Sit down young stranger  
And tell us where you been  
Well, I've been up to the mountain  
I've walked down by the sea  
I never questioned no one  
And no one questioned me  
My love was given freely  
And oftimes was returned  
I never came to borrow  
I only came to learn  
Sometimes it did get lonely  
But it taught me how to cry  
And laughter came too easy  
For life to pass me by  
I never had a dollar  
That I didn't earn with pride  
'Cause I had a million daydreams  
To keep me satisfied  
And will you gather daydreams  
Or will you gather wealth  
How can you find your fortune  
When you cannot find yourself?  
My mothers eyes grow misty  
There's a tremblin' in her hand  
Sit down young stranger  
I do not understand  
And will you try and tell us  
You've been too long at school  
That knowledge is not needed  
That power does not rule  
That war is not the answer  
That young men should not die  
Sit down young stranger  
I wait for your reply  
The answer is not easy  
For souls are not reborn  
To wear the crown of peace  
You must wear the crown of thorns  
If Jesus, had a reason  
I'm sure He would not tell  
They treated Him so badly  
How could He wish them well  
The parlor now is empty  
There's nothin' left to say  
My father has departed  
My mothers gone to pray  
There's rockets in the meadows  
And ships out on the sea  
The answers in the forest  
Are carved upon a tree  
John loves Mary  
Does anyone love me?

930,Bob Dylan,If You See Her Say Hello,/b/bob+dylan/if+you+see+her+say+hello_20021279.html,"If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier  
She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear  
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow  
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.  
  
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will  
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill  
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart  
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.  
  
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me  
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free  
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way  
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her
stay.  
  
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds  
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town  
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off  
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.  
  
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past  
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast  
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find  
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.

I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
I'm stucked in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
And I hear that whistle blowing all down to San Antone  
  
When I was just a baby my momma told me: son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that train a-pulling I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in their fancy dining cars  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But the people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me  
  
If they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine  
You bet I moved it on a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

I read again between the lines upon the page  
The words of love you sent me  
  
If I could know within my heart  
That you were lonely too  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
Upon this winter night with you  
  
The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim  
The shades of night are liftin'  
The mornin' light steals across my windowpane  
Where webs of snow are driftin'

There's a plain and a simple answer to each and every quest  
From every quiet dance who might be a special guest  
In a movie made for TV or a late night interview  
You might even find them on the Young and the Restless too  
Do ya get that restless feelin' when you hear a whistle blast  
Like an echo from the past  
Of an old engine flyin' down a road that's iron cast  
The lake is blue, the sky is gray, the leaves have turned to gold  
The wild goose will be on her way, the weather's much too cold  
When the muskie and the old trout too have all gone down to rest  
We will be returning to the things that we love best

And the scrimshaw that he had  
Of an old schooner rovin' 'neath a sky that's ironclad  
There's a kind of a restless feeling and it catches you off guard  
As we gaze off at the distance through the trees in my back yard  
I can feel that restless yearning of those geese as off they roam  
Then trade that for a warm bed and a place I can call home  
Will ya get that restless yearning when you hear the wicked blast  
Of a specter from the past  
Of a cold diesel rollin' down a road that's built to last  
Still I get that restless feelin' when I hear a whistle blast  
See an image from the past  
Of an old schooner flyin' down a sky that's overcast

939,Bob Dylan,Changing Of The Guards,/b/bob+dylan/changing+of+the+guards_20021554.html,"Sixteen years,  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves.  
Desperate men, desperate women divided,  
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls.  
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,  
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon.  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head.  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet.  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected,  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,  
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
  
Gentlemen, he said,  
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

940,Bob Dylan,Forever Young,/b/bob+dylan/forever+young_20021492.html,"May God bless and keep you always  
May your wishes all come true  
May you always do for others  
And let others do for you  
May you build a ladder to the stars  
And climb on every rung  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young.  
  
May you grow up to be righteous  
May you grow up to be true  
May you always know the truth  
And see the lights surrounding you  
May you always be courageous  
Stand upright and be strong  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young.  
  
May your hands always be busy  
May your feet always be swift  
May you have a strong foundation  
When the winds of changes shift  
May your heart always be joyful  
And may your song always be sung  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young.

941,Donna Summer,Sweet Emotion,/d/donna+summer/sweet+emotion_20042274.html,"Seems every star is out tonight to light our love  
So round the moon so full and bright so high above  
But if you look real closely there's only me, there's only you  
And when you hold me closely, yeah  
  
And now the sky melts in the sea like they are one  
It's hard to tell where one first starts and where ends one  
That's the way our love is  
You part of me me part of you  
  
That's just what love is  
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion, baby  
Sweet, sweet emotion  
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
  
You took me from the surface to a deeper deep  
Showing me that you  
And you are life for me  
Our love will last forever  
Me loving you, you loving me  
We'll always be together oh  
  
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion  
Sweet, sweet emotion  
Sweet, sweet emotion  
Sweet you got the sweetest emotion  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
  
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotion  
Sweet, you got the sweetest emotion  
Listen baby  
Listen to me  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
Sweeter than sweet  
You got the sweet emotion, yeah  
Listen to me

942,Donna Summer,Maybe It's Over,/d/donna+summer/maybe+its+over_20042225.html,"You were the first  
And you taught me how to love  
And you'll always stay close to my heart  
But it would not be fair it I wouldn't tell you now  
  
That it's over, baby it's over  
  
You took this lonely child  
And you taught it how to feel  
You took the rain clouds from my eyes  
You made fantasy seem real  
Still it hurts me so inside  
But I can't change and I can't hide  
  
That it's over, maybe it's over  
  
Oh now, I know you're not the one  
It's me  
I've changed inside  
I feel a need to be free  
It's over  
Maybe baby it's over  
  
I was a lonely girl  
Just calling out for him  
You taught me how to live  
You taught me how to love myself  
Still it hurts me so inside  
But I can't change and I can't hide  
  
That's it's over, baby it's over  
  
Oh, now I know you're not the one  
It's me  
I've changed, changed inside  
I feel a need to be free  
  
It's over  
Maybe baby it's over  
It's over  
Please don't hate me  
But it's over  
  
Don't you know that I love you  
Don't you know that I care  
Don't you know that I love you  
But I can't always be there  
It ain't you  
No, it's me  
Gonna fly like a bird  
Fly like a bird  
Yeah, I must be free
