# Artist-prediction Project ðŸŽµ

Brief description about the project.

## How does it work?
The following steps gives a brief idea about the functional structure of the code.

- The dataset is read.
- Create instances for each song and keep it in a list.
- Create feature vector by considering words present in the lyrics of all songs.
- Create a class MCP where Perceptron instances per artist is created. 
- The Perceptron calculates the scores based of feature vector and randomly initialized weight vector.
- The max score is then compared with the actual label
- Weights get updated in the Perceptron class.
- Evaluation is f-score  

## Requirements
